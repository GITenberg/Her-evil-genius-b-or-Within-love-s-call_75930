<p>There is such a profusion of good books in this list, that it
is an impossibility to urge you to select any particular title or
author’s work. All that we can say is that any line that contains
the complete works of Mrs. Georgie Sheldon, Charles Garvice,
Mrs. Harriet Lewis, May Agnes Fleming, Wenona Gilman, Mrs.
Alex McVeigh Miller, and other writers of the same type, is
worthy of your attention, especially when the price has been
set at 15 cents the volume.</p>

<p>These books range from 256 to 320 pages. They are printed
from good type, and are readable from start to finish.</p>

<p>If you are looking for clean-cut, honest value, then we state
most emphatically that you will find it in this line.</p>

<p class="center">THE CONVENT PRELUDE.</p>


<p>The summer holidays had begun and the great convent
school was deserted, all its pupils gone but two, who were
in the alcove belonging to the elder of them, and, as if that
breakage of rule were not enough, were seated on the
small white bed which was counted a crime to rumple.</p>

<p>The elder girl was eighteen, and after to-day convent
rules would concern her no more, for that very afternoon
she was going out into “the world” to earn her own living
as a governess. She was wild with excitement, and would
have been enraptured with the foretaste of liberty had it
not been for the child who clung to her, sick and exhausted
with stormy crying.</p>

<p>She looked down on her pityingly, and the reverend
mother could have told you Andria Heathcote was not
given to compassion. Her red-brown hair grew too
strongly on her forehead for that; her full rose lips were
too heavy. Yet something in the very strangeness of the
girl who clutched her had caught at her hard young heart.</p>

<p>For Beryl Corselas was only a child, and young for her
years at that. It seemed to Andria that the sins of eleven
years old were too seriously taken when they were considered
crimes, and yet her goblin ways were enough to provoke
a saint—or Sister Felicitas!</p>

<p>“Beryl, look here,” repeated Andria; “don’t cry any
more. I’ll write to you. I’m not going very far away.”</p>

<p>The child lifted her face from the girl’s shoulder. It
was a curious face, with something almost vacant about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
it, yet what the lack was no one could quite say. She had
extraordinary eyes, strangely and uncannily beautiful, so
light a brown as to be almost yellow, tawny golden under
the heavy eyelashes, that were black as ink. The warm
whiteness of her cheeks was blurred with crying, paled
with real despair, and the startling crimson of the childish
lips had been hard bitten to check the sobs that might be
heard.</p>

<p>She pushed away the long cloud of straight hair that
was not black nor brown, but dusky, a cloud of darkness
with no color to be named, from her face, and spoke with
sullen, unchildlike contempt.</p>

<p>“You won’t write!” Her eyes were like burned-out
coals. “You’ll mean to, but you won’t. You’re always
trying to save other people’s feelings outside, but inside
you never care. You’ll forget!”</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to,” said Andria, with a sudden pang. Was
she really what Beryl said? Did her hatred of giving
pain really make her more cruel in the end? She kissed
the wet cheek.</p>

<p>“If I do forget, if I am like that, will you promise me
something? Remember that I don’t mean to forget, and
that I don’t, really. Think to yourself it’s just my way,
and that some day you’ll see me again. Will you try,
Beryl?”</p>

<p>“It’s no use my trying anything without you—in the
house with Sister Felicitas!”</p>

<p>“Keep out of her way, then! Why are you always getting
into her black books?”</p>

<p>“Because she hates me. I’m never myself with her.”</p>

<p>“You are with Mother Benedicta!”</p>

<p>“I might as well be comfortable with the statue in the
chapel! I see about as much of her.”</p>

<p>She clung suddenly to the arm that enwrapped her.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you I want—you!” she gasped. “If I’m going
to be good it will be for you. Who else do I like? Just
you and animals—and I haven’t any of them except my
rabbits. And I hate, hate, hate Sister Felicitas!”</p>

<p>A shadow, tall, slight, and angular, fell on them.</p>

<p>Andria looked up with a start, since convent tradition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
was still strong in her, and she was breaking rules openly.
Sister Felicitas stood in the doorway, black against the
sunlit passage.</p>

<p>“You’ve no right to be here, Beryl Corselas,” her voice
seemed to float out into the shaded whiteness of the alcove,
calm and cool as frost. “Go away and do your weeding.
Your garden is not a pretty sight.”</p>

<p>Andria felt the quick shudder in the child’s body.</p>

<p>“Please, sister,” she said, “let me stay. Andria is going
away.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to do with that. But while I am in
charge of the kitchen-garden you must do your share
there. Go at once,” she said very softly, but the downcast
eyes were angry. Andria Heathcote could not be reprimanded,
and Sister Felicitas longed to do it; she was always
making that hateful child rebel against lawful authority.
But to-morrow she would be gone.</p>

<p>“A few minutes more or less cannot matter to you. Go
to your weeding,” she said scornfully.</p>

<p>Beryl Corselas sat up, her slim, childish body quivering.</p>

<p>“I won’t go!” her voice low and passionate. “You know
there are no weeds for me to dig up. I hate gardens.
I wish everything in yours would die, or else choke you
when you ate it—nasty, nasty old onions!” she cried, in a
transport of temper.</p>

<p>“Beryl!” Even Andria, who hated Sister Felicitas, was
aghast.</p>

<p>“You can do your weeding or not, that is for you
to say,” said Sister Felicitas, whose face was quite untroubled,
but she was trilling her fingers against her black
habit. “But it is for me to say what will happen to you
if you disobey.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what you do to me!”</p>

<p>“No?” Andria knew that far-off sound in Sister Felicitas’
voice; there was not a girl in the convent whose
nerves did not twitch when she heard it. “Then I suppose
I can send those rabbits of yours to market! It will be
time for rabbit-soup soon.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” The child’s voice was dreadful in its
wild scream of supplication. If there had been any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
in the empty corridor they must have hurried to the sound
of it.</p>

<p>“Not my bunnies. I love them. They’re truly people.
You—you couldn’t be so wicked!”</p>

<p>“If you can talk such nonsense about your rabbits, the
sooner they are gone the better,” said Sister Felicitas icily.
“No—get up, child! You will tear my habit.”</p>

<p>For Beryl Corselas was on the floor, clutching at the
immaculate black folds of the sister’s robe.</p>

<p>“You won’t take them away—say you won’t, sister!”
She paid no attention to the hand that tried to disengage
hers. “I’ll do anything, I’ll work in the garden, I’ll say
I’m sorry——” The miserable voice made a listener start,
but Sister Felicitas only drew her skirts away deftly.</p>

<p>“That you will be obliged to do,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’ll beg your pardon now,” sobbed Beryl, “only please
don’t send my rabbits to market! I’ll go and weed—I
truly will.”</p>

<p>“You make an idol of senseless things. You will be
better without them.” In “the world” the tone would
have been called cruel.</p>

<p>The child jumped to her feet, her wild, dusky hair
streaming, her face white and furious.</p>

<p>“If you take them away I’ll kill you!” she cried out,
shaking and gasping. “I hate you! You make me wicked,
and then punish me. I——” She stopped as if something
had turned her to stone.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood the reverend mother. Mother
Benedicta, who had never been known to visit an alcove,
who was high above the girls and their rulers, was in
front of her, a gracious, stately figure in her black habit
and white bands. There was a curious look on her beautiful,
placid face, enough to stop the tongue even of Beryl
Corselas in a temper. Yet she was not looking at the
child, but at Sister Felicitas.</p>

<p>“I think breaking rules and sorrow at Andria’s going
has made some one a little hysterical this morning! Is
that it, Beryl? Come to me, my child;” and she put an
arm round the sinner, who stood petrified, as if at the
sight of a saint from heaven. Mother Benedicta’s cool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
fingers felt the hot throbbing of the child’s lax hands, and
her face grew sterner.</p>

<p>“You are sorry for your rudeness to the good sister, is
it not so, Beryl? Yes!” at the dumb nod that was a lie
of despair. “I will see to the child, then, sister. I know
you are busy. Sister Ignatia is waiting for you. She
needs your help.”</p>

<p>Sister Felicitas’ face grew white.</p>

<p>“Yes, reverend mother,” she returned quietly, but her
face was not quiet as she left the alcove. To have Andria
Heathcote incite that hideous child to mutiny was bad
enough, but to have Mother Benedicta set aside her authority
was worse. And there had been that in the face
of the reverend mother that told Sister Felicitas that even
rancorous hatred must go softly.</p>

<p>“Reverend mother, my rabbits!” gasped the culprit, as
the sister’s steps died away. “You won’t let her take
them?”</p>

<p>“It was not meant, Beryl! The good sister thought
to touch your heart; that is a hard little heart, is it not?”
she said, smiling. “But run away now and wash your
face. Then you can go to my room and wait there quietly
till Andria and I come to you. I will ask Sister Felicitas
to let her onions wait for to-day.”</p>

<p>But there was no smile on her face as the child slipped
away, radiant with gratitude.</p>

<p>“It was a pity you had her here, Andria!” she said.
“But it is the holidays, after all—only it provokes Sister
Felicitas, who is always so conscientious.”</p>

<p>Andria Heathcote was brave enough, but, as a child
had been quick to see, she was too apt to let things go, to
put a good face on ugly matters. Yet now that curious
politeness of hers left her.</p>

<p>“You heard, reverend mother,” she said quickly. “That
goes on all day long. The child is growing sullen and
strange.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that, Andria?” Mother Benedicta was
not apt to talk so freely, but Andria was going away.</p>

<p>“Yes, reverend mother! I knew you did not know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
And it is true”—flushing at her own boldness—“that the
sister dislikes Beryl.”</p>

<p>Mother Benedicta sighed.</p>

<p>“The child is difficult, they tell me, and incorrigibly
idle;” but she said it chiefly to hear the answer.</p>

<p>“She can speak Spanish, and she works hard at that,
though no one knows but Sister De Sales. School is bad
for her; the girls bully her. Could you not send her home
sometimes, dear mother?”</p>

<p>“She has no home; did you not know? She has been
here since she was a baby. We do not even know who
she is.” For once the Mother Superior had forgotten
herself.</p>

<p>“Sister Felicitas knows,” said Andria quietly.</p>

<p>“What! Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“Because”—once launched, Andria was floating well—“I
heard her tell the child that she came by her mad temper
honestly—was her mother over again.”</p>

<p>Mother Benedicta stood dumb.</p>

<p>She had heard more than she liked of Sister Felicitas’
methods this morning, but this passed all bearing.</p>

<p>“You must be mistaken,” she said, for the honor of the
convent, but Andria saw her breathing quicken. “But I
have been wrong. After this I will see more of the child.
I promise you that much.”</p>

<p>To think of Sister Felicitas having known all this time
the parentage of Beryl Corselas, which had been the mystery
of the quiet convent lives, was too much even for
her charity. It seemed but yesterday since a woman,
wild, despairing, with the hand of death already on her,
had brought the child to the convent. She had been told
that no baby of three years could be taken, and had sunk
into the nearest chair as if her last hope were gone.</p>

<p>Mother Benedicta had pitied her, seeing her so ill.
(Afterward she had altered her mind about the illness;
it might easily have been furious disappointment that had
sapped her strange visitor’s strength.) She left the room
to tell a lay sister to bring wine and food, but, though she
was absent only a minute, when she returned the woman
was gone. The window was open on the garden, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the room sat a pale, yellow-eyed child, in exquisite clothing
that was marked “Beryl Corselas.”</p>

<p>That was all. Never from that day to this had they
been able to find out anything more, and only that the convent
charter provided for certain charity pupils could the
rules have been stretched to keep the waif.</p>

<p>Yet kept she was, and now a curious thrill made the
superior tremble. Yet it was impossible. It had been
six months before Sister Felicitas joined the community,
and the woman who had flung the child on their charity
had been pink-cheeked, golden-haired. Sister Felicitas
was pale and dark. And still the Mother Superior——
She forced herself to speak.</p>

<p>“I do not know what is to become of the child,” she
said. “As you say, she is very strange. I never hear any
good of her.”</p>

<p>“There is good in her. But Sister Felicitas has a repulsion
for the child. You can see it.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said the good woman; but her own
thoughts frightened her. “You had better write to her,
Andria. I will see she gets your letters.”</p>

<p>She had quite forgotten the reason that had brought
her to Andria Heathcote’s alcove in this sudden suspicion
that had sprung up. She looked unseeingly at the girl
who had spoken out against all her secretive nature. Yet
Andria’s was not an ordinary face, and worth the
watching.</p>

<p>Cleverness and self-reliance were written on the forehead,
from which the hair was brushed back convent
fashion; cleverness again in the wide eyebrows; perfect
bravery was in the full-lipped mouth, and dogged patience
in the clean chin; but the warm blue eyes had a veiled
something in them that told of reluctance to speak out,
of a temper that would hold out a right hand to an enemy
and stab effectually with the left. Not from treachery,
but because things were more easily done in that manner.</p>

<p>Mother Benedicta had meant to speak of these things,
but she turned away with only one sentence as she signed
to the girl to follow her.</p>

<p>“You will have to fight your own battles, Andria,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
she said, almost absently. “Do it well and openly, as you
fought Beryl’s to-day. And do not forget that this convent
life has been but the prelude to your warfare.”</p>

<p>Andria bowed her head for the blessing that followed.
She thought the reverend mother looked strangely old
and worn to-day.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A FRIENDLESS FUGITIVE.</p>


<p>Mother Benedicta, careful of many things, had meant
to add the mystery of Beryl Corselas to her burden, but
fate was stronger than she, who had been for so many
years the capable head of the community.</p>

<p>Two days after Andria’s departure, death had called
her very quietly. Unanointed, unshriven, and with the
questions she had meant to ask Sister Felicitas yet unspoken,
the good mother had followed the beaten pathway
the saints have left toward heaven.</p>

<p>It was Sister Felicitas who found her dead in her bed,
but it was not prayer for the superior’s soul that sent the
sister to her knees, but utter thankfulness that a stumbling-block
was gone from her path. Beryl Corselas
heard the news in stony silence. Only once had the reverend
mother ever noticed her; and yet she felt alone.
Andria, though the weeks went by, never wrote, just as
the child had prophesied; for with all her unchildlike
wisdom she never thought that it was Sister Felicitas who
opened the letters now, and that Andria’s promise was
well kept for a year.</p>

<p>After that year perhaps she dared not write to the convent—who
shall say? But her letters ceased. And Sister
Felicitas rose steadily in the community, till five years
after Mother Benedicta’s death she had been made
Mother Superior.</p>

<p>Only Beryl Corselas knew what the story of those
five years had been. Years of injustice, of petty tortures—Mother
Benedicta was not cold in her grave before the
rabbits were killed by the cook before the very eyes of
their shrieking, fainting owner—years of slow warping
of a child’s spirit till, now a girl of sixteen, she was deceitful
from fear, silent from sullen hopelessness, and
almost ugly from misery.</p>

<p>She sat alone in an empty class-room, where her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
was but a white spot in the growing dusk of evening.
The heavy lids drooped over her tearless eyes; she was
past crying now, as she was past all childish things.
Mother Benedicta would have turned in her grave had
she seen how those years of pain had changed the child’s
looks, how tall and ill-nourished she was in her out-grown
convent uniform. Sister Felicitas punished by
depriving the growing girl of proper food; she was under
sentence now where she sat in the empty class-room, and
heard the clatter of other hungry girls in the refectory.
And hunger—and something else—was making her as
dangerous as a wild beast.</p>

<p>“If I don’t get out of this I’ll kill her!” she thought,
clasping and unclasping her strong young hands. “And
I know she doesn’t mean me ever to get out. She means
to make me a nun, and it’s no use my telling Father
Parker I’ve no vocation, for he’s deaf, and never hears
what I say. She can take her time and yell at him. If I
shout in the confessional I only get punished. The other
nuns would stand up for me—some of them. But, though
this might keep me from being made a novice, they
couldn’t keep me from being made a lay sister; for it’s
in the charter that charity girls must pay the convent back
for their keep, somehow. And she’ll never let me go out
into the world to do it. I—I’d be willing to starve if I
could only get away!”</p>

<p>She got up and went to the window, heedless of bumps
against the empty forms. But outside there was nothing
to see but a November garden, cold and barren, and a
homeless cat, crossing it furtively.</p>

<p>The girl watched the miserable creature with the painful
sympathy she felt for all animals. In the dusk she
saw it leap nimbly to the top of the high wall and disappear.
The convent rebel did not even know what was
on the other side of that wall; but she knew too well
what was on this side. A lay sister’s life, spent in the
kitchens; in scrubbing and killing fowls. She shuddered.
And Mother Felicitas’ eye was always on her; always
with the same threat, the same malice.</p>

<p>She peered into the twilight. The stray cat was gone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Beryl Corselas stretched her young body, stiff with long
sitting, just as the cat itself might have done before it
started on its furtive journey. But when a sad-eyed nun
came and let her out of the locked class-room her face was
as sullenly vacant as usual. There was no one, not even
Mother Felicitas, full of self-conceit at her realized ambition,
to know that the girl’s pulses were playing a wild
tune that night, and that the childhood that had sat so
strangely on her had fallen from her like a garment.</p>

<p>Unnoticed, Beryl slipped up to bed before the other
charity pupil; and undressed in their joint alcove. Pale
and too slender in her white cotton nightgown, she passed
under the white sheet that separated her cubicle from the
next. It belonged to a rich West Indian girl, and in a box
on the table were sovereigns, as she had known there
would be. Without a pang of hesitation Beryl Corselas
took two in the glimmer of the floating night-light. Then
she lifted the sheet and slipped under it, back to her own
alcove, just in time. As she put the coins noiselessly into
her bed, the stout girl who shared the alcove came in.
She whispered sharply, though talking was forbidden:
“You’re to be moved to-morrow; sent to the kitchen with
Sister Agnes. I wish I was you; you’ll get enough to
eat. Sister Agnes is just sweet.”</p>

<p>Beryl raised her eyebrows significantly. The sister in
charge was clapping her hands as a signal for the girls
to say their evening prayers. But there were no prayers
on the lips of one girl on her knees.</p>

<p>Would it ever be quiet? Would the tossing of the girls
never cease as they twisted on their narrow beds? It
seemed years to Beryl, lying motionless in hers, longing
for the dead middle of the night to bring quiet breathing
to the hundred sleepers round her. A wakeful devil
seemed to be making his rounds among them; girl after
girl turned, tossed, and coughed; not till long after midnight
was the hush settled and complete, and not till then
did Beryl Corselas, whose blood was thumping with suspense
and determination, stir on her hard bed.</p>

<p>Absolutely without sound she sat upright and looked
about her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Her business would have been more easily done in
the dark, but in every alcove there floated a wick in
an inch of oil buoyed up in a jar full of water. In the
glimmering, unearthly light the white sheets separating
the alcoves seemed to stir, but she was used to that;
and to have put out the dull light would have waked
the heavy sleeper in the next bed.</p>

<p>Barefooted, Beryl slipped to the cold floor, dressed,
put her stolen money in her pocket, and, shoes in hand,
crept through the wide corridor between the double row
of alcoves.</p>

<p>Even the sister in charge heard no sounds as the light
step passed, and not a soul stirred in the convent as the
girl stole down the wide, polished stairs in her stocking
feet. In the lower flat it was dark; she was forced to
keep one hand stretched out at arm’s length before her
as she crept inch by inch through the silent house.</p>

<p>The schoolroom door creaked as she opened it, but
once inside floods of moonlight made her way clear. She
looked round the room, where she had sat a hungry
prisoner from afternoon school till bedtime, and in her
fierce exultation at leaving it forgot she was still hungry.</p>

<p>The window-fastening gave under her strong fingers,
the sash moved easily, without noise, and, as quietly as
the cat she had watched that evening, the girl dropped
in the frozen grass outside. Skirting the wall she
moved quickly to the very spot where the cat had crossed
it, from a kind of superstition that she must climb over
at no other place; and there mounted it with an effortless
spring just as the other wandering thing had
done.</p>

<p>With a laugh she slipped to the ground and put on
the shoes she carried. For the cat had been a good
pilot. She stood on a road that she knew led to London,
and she stretched out her arms in a kind of rapture.</p>

<p>She was free from Mother Felicitas at last!</p>

<p>But a waving shadow that came suddenly before her
eyes killed her hasty joy. It was only the shadow of
a bare, crooked tree, but its outline was like an arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
outstretched to catch her. “Beryl, you fool!” she thought.
“By morning you will be caught again unless there are
miles between you and the convent.”</p>

<p>She began to run, and not a girl in the school could
run like her. Yard by yard she got over the hard road,
till by daylight she found herself in the suburbs of the
great city, though where she did not know. She walked
on soberly till she came to a baker’s shop, and there
bought a roll. There were early risers about, but no
one looked at her, for her plain hat and coat were
ordinary enough. Presently she grew bold enough to
stop at a street coffee-stall.</p>

<p>The hot, strong stuff did her good, and as she paid
for it she began to think coherently for the first time
since she had gone to bed.</p>

<p>“I must have a place, and I haven’t one!” she pondered
as she walked on refreshed. “If I could get to Andria
I should be all right, but——” Her face grew too grim
and bitter for her years. Andria had long ago forgotten
her, and more pertinently still the child of five years ago
had never known where the grown-up girl had gone.
There was no hope in Andria. Without a friend in
the world the girl walked quietly on her aimless way.
Long before her absence was discovered—for her stout
roommate merely thought stolidly that Beryl Corselas
had got up early, and said nothing about her empty
bed till breakfast-time—she was adrift like many
another waif in the interminable streets of London.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE WHEELS OF FATE.</p>


<p>Two days afterward a shabby little chemist in a shabby
shop on the Euston road looked carelessly at a strange
customer.</p>

<p>A tall, big-boned girl in a frock too short for her
had asked for laudanum for a toothache. She looked
half-wild with pain—or despair; the chemist never
thought of the latter, and he sold her some. Her face
grew livid as he pushed a book toward her and requested
her to sign her name. It was always done, he
explained, when people bought poisons.</p>

<p>With a frightened hand she scrawled something, but
the name was so outlandish to the man as he stood
peering at it that he never noticed with what haste his
customer had left the shop. She had been a fool ever
to have entered it, yet in the new and dreadful knowledge
that two days of London streets had crowded on her
she had felt there was nothing else to do.</p>

<p>Perhaps her very innocence of the world had made
her pass scatheless through perils she only half-realized,
but that half was enough. Behind her lay the convent,
and she could never go back to that; round her were
the awful streets where policemen kept hurrying her
on, where people passed her indifferent-eyed, or else—Beryl
Corselas turned sick and faint at the thought of
those other people who had not passed on.</p>

<p>Her money had been stolen, all but the few shillings
she had put in the bodice of her frock, and when that
was done, what in all the world remained to her? No
one had ever liked her. She had no belief in any one’s
charity, and the girl’s heart swelled as she answered
her own question.</p>

<p>“Only just death,” she thought, fingering the little
bottle of laudanum she had been forced to sign her name
to get, “or Mother Felicitas—for she’ll trace me by it.
Well, I’d rather die out here than live in the convent.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
She had walked on aimlessly enough, and looked up
to see that she was in front of the entrance to a railway-station,
where people kept going in and out. With a
sudden inspiration she followed a woman inside, and
stood behind her at the booking-office. A train was
waiting, ready to leave; on the carriage nearest her
was a sign, “For Blackpool.” She knew where that was,
even with her badly learned geography lessons; it was
a long way off from London and Mother Felicitas.</p>

<p>She bought a second-class ticket, imitating the woman
in front of her. At least she could rest in the train,
since her tired feet would hardly carry her. She had
no money at all when she had paid for her ticket, and
could just manage to follow a porter and stumble into
the carriage marked Blackpool.</p>

<p>To her joy no one else entered it, and the train started.</p>

<p>The cushioned carriage was rapture to her tired body,
but before she stretched herself out on its scant luxury,
she drained the little bottle the chemist had sold her,
and threw it away. Then she curled herself up and
slept; at first uneasily, with the unaccustomed sounds of
the moving train in her dreams, and then heavily, as people
sleep themselves to death.</p>

<p>There was no peace in the world for such as she, and
at sixteen Beryl Corselas had found it out. She had
tried to get employment, but the women at whose doors
she had knocked wanted no such unearthly-looking nursemaids,
and she could do nothing else. To sleep her life
away was all she could do, and there would be plenty
of time for that between London and Blackpool.</p>

<p>Remorselessly as the wheels of fate the train rolled
on, and dreamlessly the girl slept.</p>

<p>If she had known two things she might have flung
the laudanum from her like a snake. The first was
that Andria Heathcote had been longing for her, yet not
daring to visit her in the safe refuge of the convent.
The second, that if Mother Felicitas had known that
her missing pupil had gone to Blackpool she would have
laughed silently, since that was the only part of England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Beryl Corselas had to avoid. But in ignorance
and despair the girl had drugged herself till a creepy
warmth was in her veins, and so, bound and helpless,
would deliver herself to a worse than Mother Felicitas,
unless Death, like a quiet friend, called her before such
things could be.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE LOVELY ANDRIA.</p>


<p>While Beryl Corselas slept like a dead girl in the flying
railway-carriage, a woman sat in a beautiful house
in London and wondered why she was remembering
the strange goblin child. “I’m not fit to think of her
or the convent, either,” she thought grimly. “Who
would believe that I was ever Andria Heathcote, or
brought up in a convent school?”</p>

<p>She got up and looked at herself in a glass with an
insight that does not come to happy women. The world
had taught her that a woman with a clear skin and good
teeth has it in her own hands to be beautiful, but it was
something else that had taught her to build up her beauty
as an architect builds a palace for a king.</p>

<p>Her red-brown hair was but a little ruddier than in
convent-days. She had been too wise to dye it; her
round, young face was chiseled into the firmness of a
delicate cameo by the sure hands of Love and vain
longing; her brave mouth was more scornful, more self-reliant
than of old, and the queer, veiled look was gone
from her blue eyes. They were bold, under the lashes
and brows she had learned to darken, and the head
that had bowed so easily to rebuke was set proudly now.
And yet there was little for Andria Erle to glory in.
She turned sharply from the glass. “Bah! The child
would not know me, nor I her,” she thought. “I wonder
why I am thinking of her. Oh, I’m nervous—nervous!
And I have no real cause, I can’t have any.”</p>

<p>But the step with which she paced the room was not
that of a woman at ease. She was sick with a terror
that grew daily, and she knew it. She looked at the
magnificence about her, not indifferently, as she had been
wont to look, but like a woman who holds luxury by
a frail tenure and fears to lose it. Yet the luxury
of the place came last to her troubled mind. There
was more than that to lose; love and trust, that might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
go any day. To keep her thoughts away from that she
tried to remember the convent, but it only maddened
her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother Benedicta!” she said to herself. “You
knew too little about the world when you sent me to a
house like lady Parr’s. You and the good sisters
would have thought that house hell on earth from the
things that went on there. I might have, too, if I hadn’t
been a blind fool. But I wouldn’t go back. I’ve been
happy; I’ve had my day—and I’ve no reason to think
it’s done yet. I know,” deliberately, “I’ve no reason!”
and while she swore it to herself she kept listening for
the postman’s knock.</p>

<p>It seemed to thunder through the house before she
knew it. But the servant who brought in the one letter
that had come found his mistress sitting reading, her
exquisite paled satin tea-gown in careful folds about her
languid figure.</p>

<p>Her heart knocked at her ribs as she took the letter;
as the door closed behind the man she sprang to her
feet, crushing the thin note to her breast.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank God!” she breathed, “thank God. I knew
it would come. I knew he didn’t mean to throw me
over.”</p>

<p>She kissed the senseless letter like a living thing. She
knew each line of the address—every letter was dear to
her; yet Beryl Corselas would not have known the name
on the envelope, which certainly was not Andria Heathcote.
To Mother Felicitas it might not have been so
strange.</p>

<p>It was not for five minutes that Andria opened the
letter, and when she did so she no longer thanked God
for it.</p>

<p>It was a white, haggard wretch who crawled to a
sofa and lay there staring at the written sheet in her
hand like one who cannot understand. Yet it was plain
English, and began, “Dear Andria,” as letters do. But
her face was convulsed out of all beauty as she felt those
few sentences burning into her brain; a dreadful trembling
took her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to cry; and I won’t cry!” she said savagely.
She was on her feet and across the room to where a
stand of spirits and soda waited for a visitor who would
never come back to that house. But though she poured
out neat whisky and drank it, it could not stop that horrible
trembling.</p>

<p>“I’m to go. He’s done with me!” she thought. “I—that
thanked God at the sight of his letter;” her lips
quivered in spite of her; “who’ve been faithful for five
years.”</p>

<p>She tried to read the letter slowly and sanely, but one
sentence in it seemed to leap to her eyes. “Of course
you know our marriage was nonsense. The clergyman
was never even ordained. It would not hold good anywhere,
even in Scotland.”</p>

<p>“Then what am I?” thought Andria, and, being a
brave woman, kept in the cry. She read on mechanically.</p>

<p>“The fact is I’m ruined. I haven’t got a penny left,
and my father is nearly as bad. You have plenty of
sense, you will see for yourself that I must give in to
him and marry money. He will be beside himself till
we are on our feet again and there is an heir to the
property. He would never hear of my marrying you,
even if our madness had not passed by this time. You
will understand this is not a pleasant letter for me
to write, so I will close it. I send you what money
I can spare, but you need not expect any more, for I
haven’t got it. The sheriff will seize the furniture to-morrow,
but my father’s agent will take over the house
and pay the servants. Let me have your address, like
a sensible girl. But I know you will see reason, especially
as you are not tied to me in any way, and the
end would have had to come some day.”</p>

<p>There was no signature, and there were two pages
preceding what was, after all, the gist of the matter. Andria
Heathcote, who had never been Andria Erle except
in her own mind, crept to her sofa and lay there, her
face buried in the silk cushions Raimond Erle had chosen
that very spring. But now it was November, and this
was “a last year’s nest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>She bit at her arm fiercely that pain might keep
away tears. None of Raimond Erle’s servants should
see that the woman who had never been his wife had
been crying in her shame and anger. She wondered how
much they knew. All London probably knew more than
she had done. She remembered how Raimond had had
no friends but men, how she had gone among them
by the nickname of “The Lovely Andria”; how some of
them had openly thought her shameless—the remembrance
made her writhe where she lay.</p>

<p>A silver clock chimed, and she counted the sweet
strokes.</p>

<p>“Five!” Five already, and she would not sleep another
night under this roof. The whisky had steadied her,
helped her; she rose and looked in the glass that an
hour ago had reflected a woman who had hope left in
her and saw that no eye but her own would see any
difference. Andria Erle had looked nervous; Andria
Heathcote was only a shade paler, a little harder-eyed.</p>

<p>She turned to ring the bell, and saw something on
the hearth-rug. It was a check for ten pounds, and at
first she would have let it lie. After five years he
was turning her out of the house with ten pounds!
But it occurred to her suddenly that she had no other
money in the world.</p>

<p>“It is bad to have been made a fool of, but it is
worse to keep on being a fool,” she said, with queer
calmness, and stooped for the check.</p>

<p>Another woman would have sat down and written an
answer to that letter, which would have cut even Raimond
Erle. But to quarrel openly was not Andria’s
way. If an opportunity came to repay she would repay;
it was no use to write what he need not read unless
he chose. Once more she turned to ring for a servant,
and this time did not falter.</p>

<p>“Send my maid to me,” she said. “I have had a
letter from Mr. Erle. He is not returning and I am
going away. Lord Erceldonne’s agent will pay your
wages.”</p>

<p>She spoke gently as she always did, and the servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
admired her for it; he knew, as she thought, that things
were at an end. But he liked her, as did every one
who had ever served her, and he kept his sympathy from
his face.</p>

<p>Her maid came as quickly as if she had been waiting
outside the door.</p>

<p>“I want you to pack for me at once, Louise, I am
going away to-night, and I must leave you here.”</p>

<p>“But, madam, you can never do without me,” said
the girl awkwardly. She would like to go with the
mistress who had never spoken unkindly even when she
was displeased.</p>

<p>“There is no room for you where I am going.” Andria’s
voice was gentle still. “You need not pack my
evening gowns. But you must hurry, Louise.”</p>

<p>“Madam’s jewels, of course!” said the maid, with
tears in her eyes. All the household but the mistress
had known the end was coming.</p>

<p>Andria turned to the windows.</p>

<p>“I will see to the jewels,” she answered in a suffocated
voice. “I will not take them.”</p>

<p>The maid dared not say more. But it was well that
Andria did not see her packing. Every gorgeous gown
her mistress owned was in the boxes decorously covered
with underlinen and every-day clothes by the time Mrs.
Erle came up-stairs.</p>

<p>Her jewels were spread out on the toilet-table; perhaps
the faithful maid thought the sight of them would
tempt her mistress to take them. But she shivered as
the gorgeous, shining things glittered in the candle-light.
Every one of them had meant something in the days
when love was young; each stone held its separate insult
now. She put them back in her jewel-case with
averted face and ungentle hands. Diamonds and pearls,
opals and beryls, not one would she keep; and her
wedding-ring fell with a clink on the mass. Andria
Heathcote had nothing to do with the baubles Andria
Erle had loved.</p>

<p>She stood up straight and fair as Louise dressed her
in a plain black gown. For three months she had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
dreading this day, fearing heavily to note the small signs
of its approach; but now that it was here she felt curiously
calm.</p>

<p>“Tell James to call a cab,” she said, “and this is for
you! You are a kind girl, Louise, and I have liked you.”
She held out a long gold chain set with pearls. It was
her own, not his; she had a right to give it away.</p>

<p>But the maid was crying.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, child, for me,” she said steadily, “and
take care of the jewels till Mr. Travers, the agent, comes
to-morrow. He will give you a receipt for them, and
you must send it to Mr. Erle at the club.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll come back, madam?” cried Louise, sobbing.</p>

<p>“No. Oh! my poor Louise, cheer up. There are
better mistresses than I’ve been.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” said the girl passionately, “none. What
haven’t you done for me and my mother?” The French
girl would have kissed Andria’s hand, but with a queer
feeling of superstition her mistress stooped and kissed
her cheek. It was something to have a creature to say
farewell to; there would be none to greet her home.</p>

<p>“Get the cab,” she repeated. And when the girl was
gone she went to her writing-table. There was a photograph
there and she stared at it. Why had she loved
him? He was just a long-legged, haggard, gentlemanly-looking
man, like scores of others, yet she had sold her
soul for him.</p>

<p>Her hand was on the picture to put it in the fire,
but a sudden thought flamed in her eyes and stayed her
hand. On the back of it was written: “Raimond to
Andria; on their wedding-day.” She would keep it!
The world was thick, they might never meet; but if
they did that writing might confound his dearest plans.
She slipped the photograph into her pocket and went
down-stairs. The French girl, with a pang at her heart,
watched her get into the cab and drive away.</p>

<p class="center">HER EVIL GENIUS.</p>


<p>The train stopped with a jerk and a long jolting jar
that startled all the passengers, and flung a solitary
traveler from her seat in a second-class carriage.</p>

<p>She lay on the floor, lax, inert as the dead; but her
eyes were open. Where was she? What was this hard,
narrow place, where a light burned dimly? She thought
for one awful instant of her alcove at the convent, and
screamed wildly; but the train was starting and the
whistles of the engine covered it. The noise of the
wheels reassured the drugged wits of the girl on the
floor.</p>

<p>“No; it’s not the convent—it’s the train, and I’ve
waked up! Oh, why didn’t I die? Am I going to live
after all that stuff?”</p>

<p>She struggled up and back to her seat, dizzy and
sick from the laudanum. She tried to think. What
should she—what could she—do now? Life was before
her, and not the death she had craved. Presently the
train would stop; they would put her out into the cold
and darkness, and she had no money for shelter or
bread.</p>

<p>“They ought to kill girls like me!” she sobbed. “What
good has life ever been to me! And what shall I do
if I’ve been tracked—if a telegram from Mother Felicitas
is before me at Blackpool?”</p>

<p>Every one’s hand had been against her all her life,
and it was well for her now. For a madness of determination
came over her.</p>

<p>“They sha’n’t find me! No one shall find me,” she
thought, clenching her hands. “I’ll hide somewhere and
starve sooner than go back to Mother Felicitas!”</p>

<p>She opened the carriage window and drank in the
cold evening air. It drove the fumes of laudanum from
her and stopped the headache that was rending her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
She had no reason to go to Blackpool; she could starve
as easily in some other place. What if she got out
the first time the train stopped, and slipped away into
the dark? But it had been the stoppage of the train
at Preston that had wakened her; she did not know
there would be no pause between that and Blackpool.
The train seemed to whirl interminably on, and she shut
the window and lay back against the cushions; she
would have warmth and rest as long as she could.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, she felt better for that drugged
sleep—more reasonable, more sane.</p>

<p>But, think as she might, she could see nothing but a
miserable, lingering death before her, and the death that
had passed her by would have been easy.</p>

<p>The train whistled, then stopped; the guard came and
took her ticket.</p>

<p>“Blackpool, miss,” he said to the pale girl with the
swollen, weary eyes. The convent uniform was black
and he thought cursorily that she was in mourning, a
thought that served her well afterward.</p>

<p>She hurried by him without answering, and stood
for one moment in the glaring station, bewildered by the
crowd.</p>

<p>Her white face, her tawny eyes, with that strange
vacancy about them which long years of bullying had
brought there, were striking enough among the commonplace
crowd that surged by her.</p>

<p>A long-legged, gentlemanly-looking man, whose handsome
face was haggard and drawn till it almost came
to being care-worn, pulled his brown mustache as he
stood waiting for the London train.</p>

<p>“Looks as if she were in a mess!” he thought idly.
“She might be handsome, too—it’s a pity!” and he turned
away. It was some other fellow’s business; he had
enough on his own hands without taking up a girl who
stared past him till she caught his eyes on her and then
ran with a sudden, frightened bound out of the lighted
station.</p>

<p>“The wicked flee when no man pursueth,” thought
Mr. Erle; he was rather fond of the Bible, for amusement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
merely. And he got into his train and thought
of other things, not too comfortably.</p>

<p>He had had an exceedingly annoying interview with
his father. After all he had done to please him, the
elder man would scarcely listen to his question, or indeed
speak to him.</p>

<p>At a strenuous appeal for money, indeed Lord Erceldonne
had broken out savagely:</p>

<p>“You had better discover a lady who possesses it,” he
had said roughly, unlike himself. “As for Erceldonne,
you needn’t count on the succession to it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” his son stared.</p>

<p>But Lord Erceldonne had recovered himself.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he returned icily, “except that every stick
we own is mortgaged. You must forage yourself.”</p>

<p>But his son had seen him crumple up a telegram that
lay on the table. It was not those ancient mortgages
that troubled him.</p>

<p>“I wonder what the deuce it was!” he reflected now
in the train, for distasteful as London was, it was better
than his father’s society.</p>

<p>“For a moment I thought my reverend parent was
about to impart to me that I was not the rightful heir!”
sneeringly. “He’s got something on his mind, but that
would be rot! There’s been no question of it for years.”</p>

<p>The strange girl had completely left his memory as
the train reached London; indeed, she had never stayed
there. Mr. Erle glanced at his watch as he took a cab
at Euston. It was not eleven o’clock; he would see
what fortune had done for him before he went—by
George! he had forgotten. He could not show himself
in town. There was that business of the sheriff, and
Andria!</p>

<p>“The Continent!” said he to himself. “As soon as
possible! But first I must visit my—well, I hope he’ll
be my banker!” He stopped the cab and got out at
the very shop where Beryl had bought that useless
laudanum no farther back than the morning.</p>

<p>“A shabby chemist’s,” she had thought, quite unconscious
that the drugs were but an outward show, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the proprietor was one of the largest book-makers in London,
though he never attended a race. Sometimes he
had provided Mr. Erle with sums that tided him over;
but of late that gentleman had not been lucky. He entered
the shop with a languid nod, and was glad to see
the proprietor was alone.</p>

<p>For once, too, he seemed to be paying some attention
to his legitimate trade. He was studying a greasy blank-book
that was not out of his inside office.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Erle!” he said. “I have some money for
you—a hundred or more.”</p>

<p>Mr. Erle never moved a muscle, though he needed the
money and had not expected it.</p>

<p>“Right!” he returned carelessly. “What have you got
there?”</p>

<p>“Only my register, sir. By the way, could you read
that name?” He pushed the book across the counter.</p>

<p>“B. Corselas,” in an unsteady, childish hand stared Mr.
Erle in the face. B. Corselas, and his father, neither
to hold nor to bind! There could be nothing in it, and
yet—Mr. Erle was startled.</p>

<p>“No,” he said coolly. “Cassels, or something. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, she was a slip of a thing,” dryly, “and she
bought laudanum. She had a queer look about her—very
light eyes!”</p>

<p>“Tall, charming?” scoffingly.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Erle. Childish and frightened-looking. Will
you have a check, or notes? They’re both here. She
would have been handsome if she hadn’t looked hungry.”</p>

<p>“Notes,” said Erle slowly. “You’ll get into trouble
yet, Peters, with your drugs. Good night!”</p>

<p>He was richer than he had been for many a day;
but he was not thinking of that as he got into his cab
and drove back to Euston.</p>

<p>It was queer that he felt so assured that he had seen
at Blackpool the very girl who had signed Peter’s book.
He dismissed his cab at the Euston Hotel, but before
he entered it he returned to the station. A few inquiries
made him surer than ever, but the “B. Corselas” staggered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
him. It might be all right, but if, after all these
years, it was going to be all wrong, it was no joke.</p>

<p>He wrote a brief note to his father, for there was
no sense in trusting a country telegraph office, and
then retired to bed.</p>

<p>“Paris for me!” he reflected as he put out the light.
“If there is anything queer the farther I’m out of it
the better. Besides, other things. But, of course, it’s
all a silly coincidence.”</p>

<p>He little knew the trouble it would have saved him
if he had spoken kindly to that girl at Blackpool.</p>

<p class="center">LORD ERCELDONNE MARKS THE KING.</p>


<p>On the shore of St. Anne’s, that is a day’s walking
from Blackpool, was the wreck of a brig. Dismantled,
gaunt in the daylight, black and gruesome at night, it
lay canted on the beach a grim sign-post on a coast where
the life-boat men are seldom idle.</p>

<p>The lamplighter looked at it as he finished his rounds
in the dusk.</p>

<p>“’Tis said it’s haunted,” he remarked to himself, “but
ghosts have quieter tongues than Margery! And ’tis
the only place she’ll not rout me out of.” His conscience
was not clear nor his legs quite reliable as he made an
unostentatious progress over the shingle to the wreck.
He was not drunk to his own mind, but he would be
drunk to a certainty in the eyes of the rate-payers and
his wife. Mr. Ebenezer Davids had no mind to be
brought up before the vestry or the domestic tribunal.</p>

<p>He scrambled on board the weather-beaten hull of the
<i>Highland Mary</i>, and made his way below, down a companionway
that slanted at a discomposing angle. The
darkness of the cabin was musty, but Mr. Davids was not
squeamish. He felt his way to a moldy locker and collapsed
on it. Something rustled, but he cared nothing
for rats. He only turned more comfortably and let
the joyful slumber of semi-intoxication possess him utterly.</p>

<p>The tide was rising; it lipped against the seaward side
of the <i>Highland Mary</i> with a noise that was oddly like
the frightened breathing of a weak creature. But there
was no other sound till the lamplighter’s snores began
to fill the cabin. Then came a faint rustling in the berth
opposite him, a gasp as if a desperate resolve had taken
away some one’s breath. The snoring kept on.</p>

<p>In the dark there was a sound of cautious feet; feet
that had no strength or weight; but if any one stole up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
to the lamplighter he did not hear. In his sleep he flung
out his arm, and it struck something that gave; something
that was bending over him, trying to reach a red
cotton bundle that lay between him and the wall. It was
his supper of bread and cheese that he had not eaten,
and the smell of the cheese, combined with the regular
snoring, had drawn a living thing to his side.</p>

<p>He started up, sobered with terror, sweating with fear.
What had touched him in the dark? What had screeched
in his ear?</p>

<p>“The place is haunted, curse it!” he said, and was
frightened afresh. For the instant he spoke a low moaning
broke out at his very feet.</p>

<p>The lamplighter was a little man, and not brave. In
sheer desperation and terror he remembered that he carried
the tools of his trade in a bag at his side, and with a
shaking hand he lit his long wax taper. As it burned
blue in the close cabin he recoiled.</p>

<p>The place was haunted, indeed!</p>

<p>What was this on the floor, like a white-faced girl,
whose long, black hair streamed over her? No living
woman could be so thin, could have such strange, golden
eyes.</p>

<p>“What—what are you? Get away!” cried the lamplighter
wildly. He raised his foot to kick at the thing
on the floor.</p>

<p>“Don’t! Oh, don’t hurt me!” The cry was human,
utterly desolate. “I didn’t mean to steal, but I’m hungry,”
cried the girl, with a sullen sob.</p>

<p>“Hungry!” said the lamplighter stupidly, and his taper
nearly fell in his surprise. “What are you doing here
if you’re hungry, frightening honest folk?” He grew
angry as he remembered how nearly she had sent him
flying back to Margery with a bogy tale that would
have made him a laughing-stock.</p>

<p>“I’ve nowhere else to go.”</p>

<p>At the answer he stuck his taper upright in a convenient
crack in the floor of the <i>Highland Mary</i>, and with
a rough kindness lifted the girl to the locker. She was
a threadpaper slip of sixteen or so, with the queerest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
eyes he had ever seen; even the lamplighter, who was
familiar with poverty, had never seen a human being
so thin.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re starved, lass!” he cried. “What ever
made you come to this old hulk? You might have
knowed there was no roast beef here. Where do you
come from?” for his keen little eyes saw that her shoes
were not the shoes of a tramp.</p>

<p>She did not answer, except to point to the red handkerchief
that smelled of cheese.</p>

<p>“You can have it, certain!” he had a foolish lump in
his throat as he stuffed the thick, unappetizing stuff
into her hand. And he turned away as he saw how she
tore at it with sharp white teeth like a dog’s. But she
only ate a mouthful or two.</p>

<p>The lamplighter took a seat on the locker and stared
at her.</p>

<p>“Come now, missus,” he said, not unkindly, “let us
know what brought you here. You can’t stay here till
you die—like this!”</p>

<p>“Where can I go? No one wants me.”</p>

<p>“Go back to your friends, lass!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any, I haven’t any money, either, and it
was cold and rainy, so I came in here. I’ve been ill, I
think. It seems a long time.”</p>

<p>“By gum!” the lamplighter was nonplused. “Why
didn’t you beg? Have you had anything to eat?” sharply.</p>

<p>“I hate people, and they hate me. No one would
give me anything. I went out in the nights and got
water at a brook over there, and I found some bread
one evening.” She did not say it was crusts a dog had
despised.</p>

<p>“How long have you been like this?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. More than a week. I’ve been ill, I——”
Her head fell forward with a stifled groan.</p>

<p>“You’re sick, now, my lass!” he said pitifully. “Come,
your way’s with me, and I’ll take you——” He stopped;
he dared not take her to Margery, and the only other
place was the workhouse.</p>

<p>“I won’t go to a convent,” she muttered, “I won’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“It’s not a convent,” he said, puzzled. “Just a—well,
there!—it’s hell on earth to my mind, but it’s better than
this,” he broke out roughly, for the strange girl could
not hear him; she was in a dead faint at his feet.</p>

<p>Staggering, sweating, Davids managed to carry her
up the companionway to the deck that was keeled over
at such an angle that, burden and all, he nearly slipped
through the broken bulwarks to the stony beach. But
he clawed and staggered valiantly, till he had laid the
girl, who to his mind was dying, safely on the ground.
Then he gazed about him. What was to be done next?</p>

<p>“There ain’t no choice as I can see,” remarked the
bewildered Samaritan. “Though she’s gey and heavy
for such a bag of bones.”</p>

<p>He shouldered her like a sack of potatoes, fearful that
she might die on his hands.</p>

<p>“Here goes, and prays I that Margery don’t hear of
it!” he muttered, and with toil and cursing, gained the
highway, a ludicrous figure in the light of the November
moon. His only thought was by what byway he could
come at the workhouse, and as he puzzled at it he ran
into a tall man in an Inverness cape who was coming
from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“What the devil!” cried the latter furiously. “Why
don’t you look where you’re going?”</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, my lord,” gasped the despairing
Davids. “I couldn’t look, she’s too mortal heavy.”</p>

<p>“She—who? Why, it’s you, Davids! What are you
doing?” Lord Erceldonne stared as he had never stared
in all his ill-spent life.</p>

<p>“Going to the workhouse,” said the man wretchedly.</p>

<p>“What for? And—why, it’s a woman!” said Lord
Erceldonne, with unkind enjoyment. A squint-eyed,
frowsy lamplighter with a romance was too delightful.</p>

<p>“It’s a lady, if you ask me,” retorted the man, with
some dignity. “And I think she’s over near to dying
for laughter.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?” cried Lord Erceldonne, enraged
at the just rebuke. Ebenezer told him. But it was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
dark for him to see how Lord Erceldonne’s hand flew
to his pocket where two letters lay.</p>

<p>“Put her down,” he ordered. “Let me look at her.”</p>

<p>Ebenezer obeyed, with some relief.</p>

<p>Straight and tall, her long limbs as nerveless as if
she were dead, the girl lay on the ground. Her white
face showed gaunt with famine in the moonlight as
her matted, wild hair lifted in the night wind. For a
moment both men thought her dead.</p>

<p>Erceldonne knelt down by her.</p>

<p>“Did she tell you her name?” His voice was thick.</p>

<p>“Not she!”</p>

<p>“Then she’ll never tell it now—she’s dead!” There
was something so like recognition, exultation, in the
pitiless words that Davids looked angrily at the speaker.
Then he started.</p>

<p>The pale, worn face bent over the girl was hers
almost line for line; allowing for the difference between
sixteen years and fifty.</p>

<p>“My soul!” thought the lamplighter. “She is the very
spit and image of his lordship.” He turned almost
fiercely on the man, as if he had been his equal.</p>

<p>“She ain’t dead, and she ain’t going to die, while I
can help it. Move, my lord—and let me carry her to
the workhouse while there’s time.”</p>

<p>A stranger look than ever was on Erceldonne’s face.
This was fate—but he had conquered fate before. He
burst into a cackling laugh that made Davids jump;
long and loud he laughed in the light of the moon over
the girl who lay dying on the ground.</p>

<p>“Get on with you, then, to the workhouse!” he cried
indifferently, but as he turned away his eyes were still
full of laughter, in strange contrast to his savage temper
when he met Ebenezer.</p>

<p>“I mark the king, it seems!” said Lord Erceldonne
to the desolate night. “I mark the king, after all!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">FIRST BLOOD TO ERCELDONNE.</p>


<p>Mother Felicitas sat in her white-walled parlor, and
her lean face looked gray against the whitewashed background
from which the pictured saints and martyrs
looked down indifferent-eyed. Opposite her sat her man
of business—for even convents have such things—and
his matter-of-fact manner was driving her mad.</p>

<p>“You traced that misguided child,” she said smoothly,
“to Blackpool, I think you said.” She could hardly sit
still in her chair.</p>

<p>“Easily. And then to St. Anne’s. But I regret to
say I was too late. She had been hiding on an old
wreck there starving, for nearly a fortnight, till a lamplighter
found her and took her to the workhouse. I
went there, of course, but the matron, a civil-spoken
woman, told me the girl had been taken away only
that morning by a Mrs. Fuller, who wished to adopt
her.”</p>

<p>“Did they hand her over to a strange woman without
any references?” said the mother, moistening her dry
lips.</p>

<p>“It seems so,” he answered bluntly. “They had the
address in Liverpool, but when I went there the caretaker
told me Mrs. Fuller had that morning gone to
the Continent with a young lady till the spring. Oh,
I fancy it’s all right, reverend mother! You are too
troubled about a good-for-nothing runaway.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, and hid her hands in her sleeves that
he might not see the trembling of them.</p>

<p>“But her well-being is naturally a—sacred charge to
me. I feel all this terribly.” She wondered while she
spoke how she was to find out what was racking her,
indeed.</p>

<p>“Lord Erceldonne is lord of the manor at St. Anne’s—I
suppose—he had not been interested in the sad
case,” she observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“He was away. I heard by chance.” The lawyer had
not got speech of Ebenezer Davids, who was too unimportant.
“He had not been there for months.”</p>

<p>Mother Felicitas’ heart gave a bound of relief.</p>

<p>Then it was, after all, what it looked! Some tender-hearted
fool had adopted the girl. She was not beaten—yet!</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” she said indifferently. “But did the child,
by the way, tell her name?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he answered, rather surprised; but Mother
Felicitas, of course, had never raised her saintly eyes
and did not see.</p>

<p>That was a blow; but still Erceldonne was away and
he would certainly never see the workhouse register.
He was in her power still.</p>

<p>“That is all, I think. Thank you,” she said calmly.
“We must first wait till this Mrs. Fuller returns. You
have her address? And then perhaps our stray may be
induced to return to us. You will take some refreshment
before you leave, Mr. Mayhew?”</p>

<p>But when he was gone Mother Felicitas sat cold and
speechless. Perhaps she saw herself excommunicated
if the whole story of her connection with Beryl Corselas
ever came out.</p>

<p>“At least, he does not know and never shall,” she
thought, when thought would come. “He shall fear
me till he dies, as he has feared me this many a year. He
shall pay, as he has always paid, to the enrichment of
our order,” for she, of all the convent, had alone known
the source of the roll of notes that came anonymously
each year to her.</p>

<p>She frowned thoughtfully as she began to write a
letter, dignified and guarded. It might be months in
reaching the man it was meant for, but it would reach
him in the end. It informed the guardians of the workhouse
at St. Anne’s that the lady who had so kindly
adopted the stray child had been authorized to do so by
her only friend, the Mother Superior of the Convent
of St. Mary; and that it was hoped the arrangement
would be most satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“As I hear that Viscount Erceldonne had kindly interested
himself in the case, perhaps you would be so
good as to let him know the ending,” the letter concluded,
and when it was gone Mother Felicitas breathed more
easily. Erceldonne should know that she was in keeping
of his secret still; that the sword that hung over his
head had not left her grasp.</p>

<p>But, clever as she was, she never dreamed of Erceldonne’s
face when the letter was forwarded to him in
London. He was very busy, but he let his business
stand while he chuckled over that courteous epistle.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing so dangerous as being too clever,”
he said, wiping tears of laughter from his eyes; “and
this is too good! Mrs. Fuller—oh! Mother Felicitas!
since that’s your name now—truly you have strange
friends, for a nun.”</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket two papers, the very ones
to which his hand had flown on the night he had met
the lamplighter. On one was written in an uneducated
scrawl: “The Gurl is gone Run Away.”</p>

<p>It had never entered the mind of the reverend mother
that Lord Erceldonne had no idea of paying the hush-money
for a dead or vanished girl, or that he had established
a spy in her very house in the shape of the
loutish boy who carried her vegetables to market, the
only male being in her employ. It did not even strike
her when, in a week or so, the boy gave warning and
returned to his natural orbit in Lord Erceldonne’s employ.
He was used to watching ladies for his master, and this
was only a queerer item than usual on the list.</p>

<p>The other letter was the “coincidence” his son had
thought worth telling him—a letter that would have been
wasted but for the lamplighter. Lord Erceldonne had
reason to laugh that night.</p>

<p>He swept his correspondence into a drawer as a light
knock came on his door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” he cried, and rose punctiliously, yet mockingly,
for he knew who his visitor was.</p>

<p>A little woman, exceedingly pretty, charming mannered,
and exquisitely dressed, stood on the threshold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“May I?” her voice was not quite of a piece with the
rest of her. “Dear Erceldonne! how warm your room
is!” she exclaimed, seating herself.</p>

<p>“Bad habit!” he returned vaguely. “I suppose you’ve
come to say you’re off?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“Paris!” she cried gaily. “Having accomplished your
lordship’s wishes and played nursemaid for a month, I
suppose I may go and amuse myself again. My kind
godmother, as you know,” she said flippantly, “is on the
Continent!”</p>

<p>Erceldonne laughed. Truly that Mrs. Fuller whose address
in Liverpool he had borrowed knew nothing of
this one, nor of Beryl Corselas, either.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with that child?” she continued.
“Not bring her here, surely. It would not be
edifying—for Raimond!”</p>

<p>Erceldonne’s middle-aged handsome face was utterly
blank. He had no idea of telling his charming friend
anything. She had served his purpose, and now the
sooner he saw the last of her pretty person the better.</p>

<p>“St. John’s Wood is still standing,” he remarked easily.
“As for Raimond, no one sees less of him than I,” yet
she had made him angry; there was no one weaker than
Raimond about a handsome face, and he had been
struck with this penniless girl already.</p>

<p>“I hear the lovely Andria is——” she hesitated.</p>

<p>“Gone the way of all flesh, I believe, in hope of further
exaltation,” he said, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>No one would have believed how hard he had worked
to obtain just that result as he sat looking at his visitor
with critical admiration. She really wore wonderfully!</p>

<p>“Well, you’re off! And you may have those diamonds
you wanted, to take with you.” He had caught her
expectant eyes. “What! Something finer?”</p>

<p>“I—I would rather have that paper of mine. Please,
Erceldonne!” she said, with an earnestness that sat ill
on her.</p>

<p>He rose, flicked her cheek lightly, and laughed.</p>

<p>“Not yet, my dear Emeline; I can’t spare it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>There were tears in her hard eyes as he put a velvet
case in her hand, but she dared not implore him. She
knew him. She had got his “fancy” for him; she had
hoped that would have wiped off the old score; but
the man was too careful a blackguard.</p>

<p>Only one shot did the supposed “Mrs. Fuller” fire
as she said good-by.</p>

<p>“The girl is a handful, even for you. I don’t think
you can do anything with her.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not.” Lord Erceldonne laughed in that sudden,
unpleasant, loud cackle. “Oh, my dear Emeline!
you have a short memory.”</p>

<p>The poor, painted, little sinner started; for the blow
was cruel. Erceldonne laughed again as she crept out
of the room she had entered so jauntily. He knew all
her secrets; and she had not even touched the garment’s
hem of his.</p>

<p class="center">A WOMAN’S DIARY.</p>


<p class="right-heading">
“Tuesday, Dec. 7th.<br>
</p>

<p>“I never knew how much I read till now, when I have
no books. Time hangs and hangs; writing this thing
helps to pass it, though there is nothing to put down.
I can’t think; I feel as if all this were a dream. This
horrid room in Chelsea, and all those boxes left ‘to be
called for’ at Paddington station. When they come to
sell them—for that’s what they do with unclaimed things—they
will wonder how the owner had the heart to
forget them. But perhaps they won’t know each one
of those plain dresses cost twenty pounds.</p>

<p>“I wish I had what they cost; I never realized what
it took to live. I am going to realize it well enough
next week, when I must get something to do, or starve.</p>

<p>“I write down all these sordid little sentences because
I daren’t write the only thought that is in my mind. I
would go mad if I let myself remember—and I can’t
forget. Better to put down how I’ve lived for a month
on ten pounds. I, who threw away as much of a morning
to pass the time!</p>

<p>“I pay, let me see, fifteen shillings a week here, and
buy my food besides. I ought never to have taken this
room, but it looked dreadful enough; how was I to
know that I could have got one for eight in a worse
place? I’ve been here four weeks; that disposes of five
pounds, counting my food, though I know the woman
cheats me. My bread and tea never cost ten shillings
from Saturday to Saturday. There are two pounds in
my purse, and the other three have melted. How
many fees have I paid at registry-offices? How many
women have looked me up and down when I asked
for a governess’ place, have seen through me with their
disapproving eyes? I don’t know and I don’t care—but
I’ll care to-morrow. I’m too tired to-night from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
tramping in search of an engagement and too cold in this
room. And I’m afraid. Afraid of meeting him in the
streets and having him pass me by. I’ve no spirit. I
believe I could forgive him, but in an hour I may be
just as sure I never could.</p>

<p>“The loneliness of it all frightens me, too. This room,
where no one ever comes, the streets I walk all day
in terror of meeting some man who knows. To-morrow
I must get work. I’m losing all my courage. I’d give
half my life to-night just to——”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The writing broke off, the page smeared where a quick
hand had closed the book while the ink was wet. But
on the other side it began again.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right-heading">
“Thursday.<br>
</p>

<p>“What have I done? And why does such a simple
piece of business make me feel creepy, as if I had entered
into a bargain with the devil! I’m saved! I’ve
found a situation! But I feel something saying to me
that I would have done better to starve in the streets.</p>

<p>“It was yesterday, two days after I last wrote in this
diary. I was standing in the register’s office and two
women who had wanted governesses had told me I
would not do. I felt dizzy, for I had been walking too
far. I leaned against the wall, too tired to go home, and
the registry-office was warm.</p>

<p>“I was not noticing anything because my head swam.
I was thinking that for women like me the world had
only one path, and I would die before I walked on it—any
farther. I was fighting off the horror of it when
some one touched me on the arm.</p>

<p>“It was the registry woman. She had left her desk
and there was no one in the room but her and me,
and a middle-aged man.</p>

<p>“‘Miss Holbeach,’ she was saying—I dared not go
back to Heathcote when I found I had no right to Erle.
Every one knew Andria Heathcote’s story, and Holbeach
was not noticeable—‘Miss Holbeach, don’t you hear
Mr. Egerton speaking to you?’”</p>

<p>“‘I beg your pardon,’ I said, for I was stupid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“The man handed me a chair as if I were a lady and
not a would-be governess. I sat down and then I looked
at him. I don’t know now what there was in his face
that seemed familiar. I only saw it in that first glance;
afterward I knew perfectly well that he was an utter
stranger.</p>

<p>“He was rather tall and rather dark and thin. I think
now that if he had let it his hair would have been gray,
but then I just saw it was black. He had a pale face,
wrinkled and full of crow’s-feet round the eyes, and
they were very dark, almost black. They puzzled me—their
shape—I seemed to know that. But the way they
looked at me was not like any eyes I know or ever
have known. He wore beautiful clothes and had a London
man’s manner. I mean those men you meet in the
season who are so civil and so quiet, as if no one in the
world was their superior and there was no occasion to
assert themselves. I ought to know that manner by
this time.</p>

<p>“This man seemed to take me in without looking at
me. I remembered I had on old gloves.</p>

<p>“‘This lady, I think,’ he said to the registry woman,
‘wishes to be a governess?’</p>

<p>“‘Miss Holbeach? Yes, sir,’ She frowned at me to
stand up, but I couldn’t. The man sat down by me, and
it was then I saw how lined his face was. He looked
fifty when you were close to him.</p>

<p>“‘Miss Holbeach; thank you!’ He just glanced at
her, but she went away as if he had pushed her. Then
he spoke to me. He wanted a governess, or rather a
companion, for his ward, a girl of sixteen. Lessons were
not so much an object as being willing to go abroad.
His ward was obliged to winter in the South. She was
not strong. I could only stare at him; the thought of
getting a situation and getting out of England at the
same time nearly made me cry with joy—till I remembered
a man like this would never take me for his ward’s
governess.</p>

<p>“‘I won’t do,’ I said. ‘You will not want me. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
not any—any references!’ My own voice sounded so
odd to me, as if I had never heard it before.</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ he said slowly, ‘you have no references,’ and I
saw something so queer in his look that I could not
answer from astonishment.</p>

<p>“A woman like me, who watches a man’s face for
sunshine or bad weather, learns little things. This man’s
forehead, instead of contracting between the eyebrows
with annoyance, had grown smooth with relief. I couldn’t
understand it then, and I can’t now; but I know he was
relieved that I had no references.</p>

<p>“‘This woman knows you?’ he said.</p>

<p>“‘Only because I came here for work,’ it was no use
pretending things, and I didn’t try.</p>

<p>“‘You have not always been a governess, is that it?’
He spoke so quietly that I knew the woman at the desk
could not hear him, but I answered out loud:</p>

<p>“‘I was educated for a governess, but I have had
no need to earn money for some years. Now I must—do
something,’ and I couldn’t keep my lips steady.</p>

<p>“‘Ah!’ he said. ‘And without a character you have
been unsuccessful!’ But I saw he was not sorry for
me, only thinking what to do or how to do it. For
I knew, as I know that I sit here in this room with
its fire and the rain on the window, that he was going
to engage me.</p>

<p>“And he did. Without a rag of reference, with only
a few questions—and now that I come to think of it he
never asked me where I was educated. I couldn’t have
told him. I suppose Mother Benedicta knows how I
ran away from Lady Parr’s with—but I won’t write
that name.</p>

<p>“But it has all come to this: I, who had no hope
of ever getting an engagement, am to be companion to
a girl at a salary of a hundred pounds a year. And
I know that I’m not fit to be with any girl; the five
pounds that he gave me for expenses looks like a fee
from the devil as it shines on the table. For the more
I think of it, the more sure I am that he was certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
I was a woman with a past and not anything else in
the world.</p>

<p>“But past or no past, I will write it down here in
this book, and sign my name to it, that no girl shall
ever learn harm from me, or anything but hatred for
evil. My schooling has been hardly paid for; it can at
least be useful in helping some poor girl to keep out
of the agony I have known. There is no peace or joy
for women like me, and I would never see any girl
stray on the bitter road that I trod. If Mr. Egerton,
for reasons of his own, has engaged me because I am
what I am, he has burned his own boats. If the girl
is as sly and sullen as he hints, I will be a better guardian
for her than a saint like Mother Benedicta was for me.</p>

<p>“I have read this over, and it seems far-fetched and
ungrateful. The man is kind and he is giving me a
chance to live honestly; but yet I cannot feel that in
my heart. There is something behind his kindness.</p>

<p>“Whether there is or not, I can’t get out of my bargain
now. I am to go to Southampton to-morrow, to
join Mr. Egerton and his ward on his yacht; a steam-yacht,
thank goodness! I hate the sea. We are to
go to Bermuda, of all places in the world! Not that
I know any one there, but it seems the very end of the
world.</p>

<p>“Mr. Egerton has a house there, and if his ward likes
it, we may stay till spring. It is all one to me, since I
shall be out of England. To-morrow I must get those
boxes at Paddington that I never meant to call for. I
would be glad never to wear any of those clothes again,
but I have no choice. The five pounds he gave me
would not buy my ticket to Southampton and get me a
governess’ outfit ‘warranted to wear’ into the bargain.</p>

<p class="center">ON BOARD THE YACHT.</p>


<p>Mr. Egerton sat in the smoking-room of the steam-yacht
<i>Flora</i> and reflected—it was the first day the sea
had favored reflection—on his plans.</p>

<p>They had given him more trouble than anything for
sixteen years, but this very elaboration of detail pleased
the man. He was a very cruel person, and a very cautious
one, or he might have solved all his difficulties
more easily and inexpensively. But wonderful as his
luck had been lately, he was not out of the wood yet.
He took up a tumbler of whisky and soda, and watched
the mounting bubbles as if he were watching the workings
of his own mind.</p>

<p>“First,” he mused, “there was getting out of the power
of that woman in the convent. She can never threaten
me now, to any effect; or turn on me. I know nothing
of any girl. She cannot say there ever was one.
She never could have, really. Second, there were those
letters. Raimond is an ass, but if it hadn’t been for
him I never should have stayed at Erceldonne, or come
across that girl with the lamplighter. That saved me
from having to scorn all England and from having to
trust detectives—who retire and write books. And the
‘Mrs. Fuller’ comedy was lucky; it prevented my appearing
in any way. And ‘Mrs. Fuller,’ having played her
part, will never bother her head about what happened
to her charge. If she did, she would never connect ‘Mr.
Egerton,’ the governess, and his ward, with Lord Erceldonne’s
queer ‘fancy.’” He laughed aloud. And then
he thought of that diplomatic epistle of Mother Felicitas’,
that had been so futile a lie.</p>

<p>“She could dictate to me while she had the girl, but
not when there is no girl for her to produce. Third,”
he resumed his counting, “there was my coming on that
woman in the registry-office. The minute I saw her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
I knew she had a history, was at the end of her tether
and in despair. No troublesome questions from a woman
like that! She swallowed everything I told her
because, forsooth, I had taken her without references.
A woman who had no references and was dressed like
a duchess was a fitter woman for my purpose than all
the Mrs. Grundys in England. She stood being hustled
on board and hurried off without a sight of her charge
like a lamb, just because she didn’t care a straw what
happened to her. I could see it in her face. And it’s
just as well she doesn’t!” His own face contracted a
little as at something slightly, yet unavoidably, unpleasant.
“Well, no one will inquire about either of the
ladies if their absence is prolonged!</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell her that obstinate little devil down-stairs
wouldn’t see her, wouldn’t hear of her. She’ll find out
soon enough what a handful she has before her, while it
lasts. But whatever happens, no one will be able to
root out dangerous tales of me and my tawny-eyed
young friend. Mr. Egerton and his ward and governess
having disappeared into space will not trouble Erceldonne.</p>

<p>“It was lucky Raimond was out of the way; it would
have suited him to rout out things he would be a fool
to know. He might even have fancied the girl. I wonder
what set his mind on an old story! But it doesn’t matter.
The affair will be nothing but a lying rumor soon;
an absolutely absurd canard.”</p>

<p>He drank down the whisky and soda with small enjoyment,
for it was flat, and the only troublesome reflection
of the afternoon came to him.</p>

<p>“Damn that fool who put Beryl Corselas and her adventures
in the papers,” he thought angrily. “The name
might have set people thinking. But I don’t think so.
I stayed long enough in London to be sure there was no
revival of stale talk. Anyhow, if there were, it doesn’t
matter. She’s disappeared, and by —— this time she’ll
stay disappeared!”</p>

<p>He rose and looked out of the window.</p>

<p>It was a deck cabin, and almost within reach of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
arm sat the governess looking vaguely out over a sea
that was blue for the first time in the six days since
they had left England.</p>

<p>It was rough still, but the rollers had purple hollows
instead of gray ones, and curled over blue and clear.
But the governess was not thinking of them, and her
employer knew it. He rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Take this to Miss Holbeach,” he ordered, penciling a
note, and then buried himself in a French novel as one
who is luckily far away from an unpleasant business.
That little tiger-cat had fought hard. First, against
the departure of “Mrs. Fuller,” to whom she had taken
a fancy; and then against the installation of a governess.
To “Mr. Egerton” himself she maintained a stony sulkiness;
she did not like him, and took no pains to hide
it. She had openly accused him of tricking her about
Mrs. Fuller, and would not listen to his plausible tale
of explanation.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you bother about me!” she had
said, staring at him. “But I don’t seem able to get away
from you. I don’t suppose you and the governess can
be any worse than Mother Felicitas! Yes, I know you’ve
been good to me, but——” She had stopped, afraid to
go on. Only anger with this strange man who had
carried her off from Mrs. Fuller had made her so outspoken,
and as he looked at her, she dared not go on. She
had turned and fairly run to her cabin, where she had
stayed ever since, too seasick even to wonder at the
strange turn her life had taken.</p>

<p>Andria took the little note the steward handed her.
He was an Italian, as were all the ship’s company, even
to the stewardess. None of them could speak a word
of English, and she knew no Italian. It had come to
her oddly that one of the few questions Mr. Egerton
had asked her was whether she knew Italian. But she
resolutely assured herself that the two things had no
connection. The note was just a line.</p>

<p>“Would Miss Holbeach kindly go and see Mr. Egerton’s
ward in her cabin.”</p>

<p>The writer, to be truthful, had wanted the meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
over between the two. The die was cast now; neither
could get away from the other, and if they had sense
they would make friends. They would need to be
friendly! And he grinned over his novel, wondering if
the headstrong child would try to scratch the governess’
eyes out. If faces meant anything, this Holbeach
woman had managed men in her day.</p>

<p>Andria was half-way down the companionway as
he thought it; and stood presently at a closed door. She
knocked, and the stewardess came out.</p>

<p>For a moment the governess was silent. She did
not know the name of her pupil, had never heard it all
this time; she did not know who to ask for. Then she
laughed, for the Italian woman would not have understood
her in any case. At the sudden lifting of the
lowered blue eyes the maid moved aside. Andria, without
waiting, went into the cabin.</p>

<p>It was full of fresh air from an open port-hole, but
in the berth, heedless of air or sun, lay a huddled figure
with its face to the wall.</p>

<p>Nothing could be seen of the girl but a pale averted
cheek, and a wild mass of dusky hair neither black
nor brown. Why did the years roll back at the sight
of that hair, dark and lusterless, a color without a name?
Andria was weary and unstrung, body and soul; she
started at the uncanny, waveless hair.</p>

<p>“Are you better?” she said, and her voice was oddly
troubled. “I hope you are.”</p>

<p>“Go away! I don’t want you,” said an angry, stifled
voice from the pillows.</p>

<p>At the sound of it Andria honestly gasped. Was she
dreaming that she was back in the convent again, or—did
she know it?</p>

<p>With the quick gentleness that was of convent learning,
she shut the door on the waiting stewardess.</p>

<p>“Beryl!” she cried, under her breath. “Beryl, is it
you?”</p>

<p>The figure in the berth started up, sweeping aside
its veil of hair with a hand and arm as thin as a goblin’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
The strangest yellow eyes in the world stared from a
white face at the intruder.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s I,” said the indifferent, insolent voice of long
ago. “I suppose you’re his governess?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me?” Andria was trembling with
nameless joy. Could it be true that her pupil was no
stranger, but the child she had loved long ago?</p>

<p>“No!” said Beryl Corselas, with the old vacancy in
her face. “Unless——” she paused and looked straight
in Andria’s eyes. The next instant she was out of bed,
taller than Andria in her long white night-dress. “Andria!”
she cried; “Andria,” and flung her thin young
arms around the woman in her black Redfern gown.
“How did you come here? Where have you been all
this time? Did he find you for me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Andria helplessly. “How are
you his ward, and when did you leave the convent?”
She held the girl off and looked at her.</p>

<p>It was Beryl Corselas, indeed, but the five years that
had passed must have dealt hardly with her to have
made her into a girl like this. A quick pang shot through
Andria at the sullen hopelessness of those yellow-brown
eyes.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she said quickly, “did you never get my
letters? Did Mother Benedicta never speak of me?”</p>

<p>“Mother Benedicta died the week you left,” the girl
answered simply. “Sister Felicitas is reverend mother
now.”</p>

<p>“But you—how are you here?”</p>

<p>The girl told her, leaving out nothing. And if Andria
had been distrustful before, she was frightened now.</p>

<p>Mr. Egerton, whoever he was, had no right to Beryl
Corselas. There was more in his adoption of her than
appeared. Andria saw quite well why he had dispensed
with references in engaging a governess; he did not want
any one with a good character as a trustworthy person.</p>

<p>“Beryl,” she said slowly, “don’t tell him you know
me. Let me tell him myself.”</p>

<p>“I never tell him anything. I don’t like him,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
said calmly. “But doesn’t he know? Didn’t he get
you on purpose?”</p>

<p>“No. He never even told me what your name was.
And oh! I——” she stammered, “my name’s Holbeach
now, don’t forget and say Heathcote!”</p>

<p>“Are you married? And——” she stopped, looking
at Andria’s black gown awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” said Andria sharply. “I’ll tell you by and
by,” for some one had knocked at the door. It was
the stewardess, and she pointed to the open port-hole.</p>

<p>“We shall be there to-morrow. We are arrived,” she
said. The words Andria did not understand, but the
gesture was plain enough, and the governess looked out
of the open port.</p>

<p>Something like a blue cloud was visible as the yacht
rose and fell. Andria ran on deck. There it stood on
the port bow, a high, blue coast, mountainous against the
sunset. As she stood leaning over the rail she saw Egerton
at her elbow.</p>

<p>“What is that land?” she said quickly. “I did not know
we passed any after Madeira!”</p>

<p>“Neither we do. This is Bermuda,” he said carelessly.
Not a muscle moved in the governess’ face. No yacht
could go from Southampton to Bermuda in six days; even
a big liner could not do it.</p>

<p>“Already?” she said slowly.</p>

<p>“The boat is fast,” he answered, but he turned away
quite satisfied, for there had been no hidden meaning in
her voice.</p>

<p>Andria, left alone, never stirred.</p>

<p>Where this man was taking her and Beryl, or for what
mysterious reason, she did not know; but that high land
that towered against the sunset was certainly not Bermuda.</p>

<p>The governess’ nerves tightened sharply.</p>

<p>What could this mystery round Beryl Corselas be?
And of what evil was that lie about Bermuda the beginning?</p>

<p>Calm water and the stoppage of the engines roused
Andria from her first sleep after a wakeful night. It was
daylight, and the sun was shining. She was on deck as
soon as she could dress, but her very hurry made her take
a long time.</p>

<p>The yacht lay in a small, almost landlocked, bay; the
water was exquisitely blue, shoaling to green where it
lapped on a white beach. A keen, heavy scent of wild
orange-blossoms came from the high shores that looked
an impenetrable tangle of thick woods; and behind, dark
against the rose and gold of the morning sky, rose a high
mountain, that cast a long, threatening shadow over the
smaller slopes that ran to its feet.</p>

<p>Utterly puzzled, Andria stood staring, scarcely even
noticing the warmth of the scented air. She turned as
Beryl Corselas came to her side, pale and half-awake.</p>

<p>“Is this Bermuda?” she said pettishly. “Thank goodness,
for I hate the sea! But I don’t see the house.”</p>

<p>“What house?” asked Andria sharply.</p>

<p>“Mr. Egerton’s, where you and I are to spend the
winter with him. Didn’t you know?”</p>

<p>Andria was speechless, for the place looked a desert
island.</p>

<p>“Look, there he is now!” she said, with surprise. “He
must have been on shore.” Beryl pointed to one of the
yacht’s boats that was pulling off to them from the white
beach. It was certainly Egerton who sat in the stern.</p>

<p>“Beryl,” Andria said sharply, “I hate teaching you to
be deceitful, but mind you don’t let him know you’ve ever
heard of me before. I don’t know why, but I don’t trust
him!”</p>

<p>“Neither do I. Yet but for him I might be back with
Mother Felicitas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“I know, and I’d be starving. I was very poor when
he found me. But I’ll tell you all that later on.”</p>

<p>“Not all,” she thought, as she moved from the girl as
Egerton reached the yacht; “just enough. I wonder if
I should have told her this isn’t Bermuda! I don’t see
what good it would have done. Whatever it is, we can’t
get away from it or him. There’s something queer, and
Beryl’s the key to it. But I can’t do anything till I find
out a little more. I wonder”—looking at the pale, indifferent
face of her charge—“if she knows more than she
pretends. All this may be clear as daylight to her, for all
I know.”</p>

<p>For sullen reserve was written on the handsome, obstinate
face, and Beryl had always been odd enough.</p>

<p>“So,” said Egerton lightly, as he joined the governess,
“you have been making friends with your pupil. She is
a queer mortal.”</p>

<p>Andria, looking at him, could hardly repress a start.
She saw now what had been familiar to her in this man’s
face. He was as like Beryl Corselas as middle age can be
like youth, except about the mouth. Where the girl’s was
sullen and timid, his was clear-cut, decisive. But the
difference in the eyes was only in color; his were all but
black; hers uncanny, tawny gold, like old wine; the shape
of the eye-socket was exactly similar in both faces.</p>

<p>A queer compunction came over Andria. Perhaps the
man was Beryl’s father! That would explain almost
everything—except that senseless lie about Bermuda.</p>

<p>“We have made friends, yes,” she said slowly. “Miss
Corselas tells me we are to stay here?”</p>

<p>He nodded, and watched her as she looked all round
the tree-covered hills, where no houses were to be seen.</p>

<p>“You don’t see anywhere to live? My house is up
there, a short distance from the shore,” said Egerton,
pointing directly in front of him. “I have just been there
to see that the servants were prepared; we are going on
shore to breakfast. Please don’t turn pale, we will have
some coffee before we go.”</p>

<p>As in a dream, Andria Holbeach—who had so short a
time since been Andria Erle in a very different place, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
with no better right—found herself being put on shore
like cargo. There seemed no need for such haste, and she
saw with wonder how quickly the sailors were getting out
of the boats not only her own and Beryl’s boxes, but packing-cases
of stores. But she had little time to watch
them. The instant Mr. Egerton set foot on the firm,
white sand, he led the way up a narrow path that could
not be seen from the yacht.</p>

<p>“After me, please, Miss Holbeach,” he said, with a
total change of manner. “And look out for the llanos.”</p>

<p>What llanos were she did not know, but she soon saw.
Great ropes of some vine were thick across the neglected
path, a very trap for unwary feet. Sharp edges of uneven
rock cut her boots as she hurried after Egerton.
The man, for his age, was getting over the ground marvelously.</p>

<p>High on each side of the path were wild orange-trees,
pinky-white with blossoms and headily sweet. Scarlet
hibiscus flaunted great flowers the size of her two hands;
lilies sprang everywhere on the lower ground; pink and
white heaths showered her with their tiny petals as she
brushed past thickets of them.</p>

<p>“I can’t walk so fast,” said Beryl from behind her.
“Tell him to wait.”</p>

<p>Egerton looked round.</p>

<p>“It is not a good place to loiter in, this low ground,”
he observed; “the scents are heady in the early morning.”</p>

<p>Andria, to her surprise, saw that his hurry was not
put on; he was glancing round him with real apprehension.
And what could there be to fear in a paradise of
flowers like this?</p>

<p>“Do you mean there is fever here?” she asked, catching
up to him.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered shortly; “merely what I said. The
flowers give one headache; the place is overgrown with
them.”</p>

<p>It was to a certainty. Blossoms she had never heard
of dangled sweet-scented tassels in her face; the soft,
warm air was like a greenhouse. But she had no time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
to look as Egerton hurried on. The path, at times, was
but a thread; she had to help Beryl over rocks and
through thickets, for her head was still dizzy from the
voyage. And all the while the anxiety on their guide’s
face was plain; it shook Andria’s nerves in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly the rough path ended among great rocks,
higher than a man’s head. Egerton led the way through
them, and they emerged suddenly on an open space of
coarse turf, with great trees scattered over it. Hot and
breathless as she was, Andria saw that the apprehension
was gone from Egerton’s face; whatever their danger
had been, it was past.</p>

<p>“There is the house,” he said; and as they went slowly
across the dewy grass an exclamation broke from her.</p>

<p>She had expected a low wooden bungalow. The house
that they came on from behind a screen of trees was fit
for a palace.</p>

<p>High and white it stood in the morning sun, built of
creamy stone; all porticos and shady verandas. Green
jalousies shaded the balconies, and behind the great pile
the ground sloped upward, so that it stood against a
background of flowering trees.</p>

<p>Yet something in the look of the place filled Andria
with terror. She, who feared nothing since she had nothing
left to dread, felt her blood turn cold. The house
looked evil; evil and wickedness lurked in it as in a nightmare;
the orange and scarlet creepers that decked the
lower verandas flaunted like sins in the morning sun.</p>

<p>As she went up the broad, white steps and crossed
the threshold into the hall, a shudder of unutterable fear
took her. And yet there was nothing but luxury in the
room she entered. She looked at Beryl. There was only
weariness in the girl’s face as she sat down in the first
chair she came to and looked listlessly about her.</p>

<p>An empty vestibule had led into a large room, lined,
floored, and ceiled with polished wood. Gorgeous rugs,
gorgeous silk cushions covered the plainness of the wickerwork
furniture; tastelessly arranged flowers were everywhere,
and even a piano stood against the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>Egerton, his face as calm and matter-of-fact as if he
had never hurried them up that narrow path like a man
in dread, pulled an old-fashioned bell-rope; a colored
woman in spotless white stood in the doorway before the
sound of the bell had ceased.</p>

<p>“Breakfast waiting, sir,” she said, gazing at the two
strange ladies curiously.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Here is your new mistress, Salome,” he said, turning
to Andria. “Mind you take care of her and this young
lady.”</p>

<p>“For de Lawd’s sake, sir,” said Salome, “dat’s certain.
Don’t I always——”</p>

<p>Andria, behind Egerton’s back, knew that his eye had
cut the woman short.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">TWO WARNINGS.</p>


<p>All through breakfast she sat like a woman whose every
perception is sharpened by fear. The very ordinariness
of that meal, served faultlessly by Salome and another
colored woman, only seemed to make her more curiously
fearful. The lie about Bermuda, the breathless hurry up
the path, the sudden relaxing of the vigilance in Egerton’s
eyes as they came out on open ground, were all
parts of a puzzle she could not fit together. She sat ready
for anything as she ate mechanically; but even she was
not prepared for what was coming next.</p>

<p>From her seat at the table she had heard the voices of
the sailors as they brought up the endless boxes, heard
the thump with which each one was deposited in some
back veranda—for solid as the house looked, inside it
resembled a whispering gallery. A colored woman came
in and told Egerton the things had come. Should the
men go?</p>

<p>He rose hastily, and said something from the veranda
to the waiting sailors before he turned to the maid.</p>

<p>“Give them breakfast,” he said shortly, “and then we’ll
be off!”</p>

<p>We! Even Beryl looked at him, though so far nothing
in this strange place had seemed to rouse her from a
dull apathy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Egerton said quietly, “I’m going, too. I shall
leave you two ladies in Salome’s charge. I may be gone
a month or six weeks. I have some business. But you
will be quite comfortable here; it is certainly quiet;” and
he laughed in that harsh cackle that was so out of character
with his polished voice and manner. The sound of
it grated on Andria’s nerves.</p>

<p>“But what,” she began, “I mean, is there no one in the
neighborhood—are we alone on this island? What shall
I do if Miss Corselas is ill?” She was so confounded
she could scarcely speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“Salome can look after her. She has all sorts of medicines,”
he returned. “Neighbors? No, you have none.
You need fear no interruptions in either your work or
play.”</p>

<p>“But I thought there were any amount of people in
Bermuda!” Beryl had lifted her head and was staring
at him with those strange, tawny eyes.</p>

<p>“Bermuda is a big place,” he said, with a slow smile.
“You won’t see many people, and I shall come back as
soon as I can——” He turned suddenly to Andria, who
sat pale and motionless, certain that his coming back
would be a long time in arriving. “My leaving you is unavoidable,”
he said, as if he knew her thoughts, “and also
for the best. You will learn to know each other better
without a third person. You may go about as you like,
but I may as well tell you that most of the country behind
the house is impenetrable scrub, but quite safe if you care
to try it.” And it seemed as if his harsh laugh broke out
against his will, so quickly did he check it.</p>

<p>“The only things I warn you not to do,” he went on,
“are to go out at night, and to go up and down to the
shore by that short cut we used this morning. You might
easily hurt yourselves there; slip on the rocks, trip on the
vines; a hundred things. And Salome will show you a
better road when you wish to bathe or sit by the sea.
But above everything”—and he lifted his hand impressively,
and Andria stared as if she were fascinated where she
sat—“do not stay out after sundown, and never, never stir
one step outside after dark.”</p>

<p>There was something in his voice that carried warning
and conviction.</p>

<p>“If you take my advice,” he continued, a shade less
earnestly, “you will not even walk on the upper verandas
after nightfall. The lower one you must never think of
but by daylight. The air is health itself in the day, but at
night it gives fever. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” said Andria, whiter than a sheet of paper.
“Quite.”</p>

<p>“Then I will bid you good-by. It will be no time before
you see me again. The days slip by here, you will find.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>He opened the door for them to leave the room, and
shook hands with studied courtesy as they passed.</p>

<p>The governess never looked at him; she was quivering
with rage.</p>

<p>Beryl was so like him that she might easily be his
daughter, and he was leaving her here with a woman of
whom he knew less than nothing, whom he had chosen
because she had absolutely no qualifications. And leaving
her, too, in a place he owned was fever-haunted. If it had
been in Andria’s power she would have knocked him
down, and taken Beryl at a run to the boat. But, even if
she did this, it would avail her nothing.</p>

<p>Beryl was tired out, and one of the colored women
showed her to her room.</p>

<p>Andria remained in the dining-room, absorbed in her
reflections.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard the sound of voices on the veranda
without. She went to the window, and, screened by the
jalousy, saw Egerton and Salome.</p>

<p>“So you haven’t seen anything of him lately?” Egerton
was saying.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Salome; “not a hoof of him been
round here since summer. Dey won’t be no more accidents
dis time. He’s gone, and—dey’s gone, too.”</p>

<p>“Well! that’s good news,” he said slowly; and why did
she think there was disappointment in his voice?</p>

<p>“But don’t let those two ladies go out after dark, all
the same! There’s fever; remember that!”</p>

<p>“Might as well kill ’em as scare ’em to death,” said the
woman shrewdly. “But I’ll lock up every night same as
always. Dat nigh shook me into my grave, dat last
trouble.”</p>

<p>“See, then, that there’s no more,” he said sternly.
“You’re responsible for them till I come back. And I’ll
have no talking to them, mind that. You can’t afford to
know anything about accidents, and I suppose neither of
the others know anything to tell.”</p>

<p>“Not one of ’em.” Her voice shook as if at some horrible
memory. “You think I tell what I find, and bury?
Nobody knows nothing ’bout dis nigger——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“But me,” said Egerton slowly. “And what is done
here you are responsible for, and you know it.”</p>

<p>She had good reason to. She broke out into a flood
of protestations that he cut short; and while the listener
stood trying to make sense of them she heard the man’s
soft, quick footfall leaving the veranda.</p>

<p>She had no mind to speak to him now. She knew there
would be no satisfaction from him; nothing but smooth
lies. Before she could move she heard Salome speaking
to herself where Egerton had left her.</p>

<p>“‘Take care o’ dem ladies,’ he says,” she broke out in
a kind of wail. “‘You’s ’sponsible.’ But who’s going to
take care of me, an’ Chloe, an’ Amelia Jane? Nothin’ but
our own black skins. Praise de Lawd dis day dat I ain’t
white!”</p>

<p>She shuffled off, and Andria went up-stairs, pale and
half-distraught. What sixth sense made her sure that all
this show of warning, of caution, only covered something
that was meant to happen.</p>

<p>“You’re responsible,” he had said to Salome, and a horrible
conviction was cold at Andria’s heart. If anything
dreadful overtook her and Beryl, Egerton would have
washed his hands of it. He had warned them and their
keeper!</p>

<p>Sick with apprehension, Andria almost ran against
Amelia Jane, waiting, stout and attentive, on the landing.</p>

<p>“You looks terrible tuckered out, missus,” she said respectfully.
“Best lie down and rest.”</p>

<p>Andria nodded; and then spoke on a sudden impulse.</p>

<p>“Is this place Bermuda?” she said.</p>

<p>“Law’s sake, missus, certain it is! Didn’t you know
dat?” the colored woman said emphatically.</p>

<p>“No,” said Andria slowly, walking past her.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE HAUNTING EYES.</p>


<p>Beryl Corselas, wearied out, had slept from ten in the
morning till late afternoon.</p>

<p>Now, as she sat in the drawing-room with the western
sun pouring through the open doorway, she looked a different
girl; one whom Egerton would scarcely have
known.</p>

<p>Her dusky hair was dressed like Andria’s, her golden-tawny
eyes shone serene in her pale face; even the crimson
of her lips was brighter. For the first time in all her
miserable young life she was happy. As a child, she had
worshiped Andria Heathcote, and to be alone with the
only human being she had never feared or deceived was
rapture to her; even in this lonely island, with not a creature
but themselves and the black servants. The drawing-room
looked wonderfully homelike, with its open piano
and comfortable tea-table, to the two who were so
strangely met after five years.</p>

<p>“Andria,” Beryl said, drawing a long breath and clasping
her thin young arms round her knees, “why are you so
quiet? Why aren’t you like me, ready to dance because
you’re free? Free—but you can’t know what it is to me!”</p>

<p>“‘Free among the dead,’” quoted the elder woman
softly under her breath, but Beryl’s ears were good.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”—looking up from her low seat
with eyes like wells of golden light.</p>

<p>Andria rose, and opened the two doors of the room.
There was not a soul in sight, and from somewhere she
could hear the servants talking over their tea.</p>

<p>“Beryl, how brave are you?” She had shut the doors
softly and come very close, so that her voice was but a
whisper.</p>

<p>“I don’t know!” said Beryl, startled. “Rough words—Mother
Felicitas—always made me a coward. But there
are neither here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“There’s something. I don’t know what. Listen”—Andria’s
voice was suddenly protecting, motherly—“and
don’t speak loud! You heard Mr. Egerton warn us not
to go out after dark on the verandas, or use that path.
Well, there is some reason, I can’t tell what. I heard
him talking to Salome, and I know the place isn’t safe.
And he knew it when he brought us here.”</p>

<p>“He only said we’d get fever if we went out after
sunset. If he wanted us to, he wouldn’t have warned
us,” said Beryl sensibly.</p>

<p>“I know! But——” The shrewd reason of Salome’s
“might as well kill ’em as scare ’em to death” came back
to her. She must not fill the girl with fear like her
own—only she wished she had not overheard that talk
about accidents! She began to walk up and down the
room restlessly.</p>

<p>“I can’t see why he brought us here!” she cried, but
guardedly. “What reason could he have? Think, Beryl,
why do you imagine he ever took you away from that
Fuller woman? What did he say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; but that she was too poor to be able to afford
to be kind.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he knows anything about you—is anything
to you?”</p>

<p>“No, but kind as he has been, I can’t like him.”</p>

<p>“Why did he pretend to bring us to Bermuda, and leave
us in a place like this? That is what puzzles me. I
would think he knew something of you; wanted to hide
you away safely, if——” she broke off. It was no use to
say “if I didn’t feel that this was a dangerous place, and
that he deceives us about it because he didn’t want us even
to know where he had taken us.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said Beryl, staring. “Isn’t this
Bermuda?”</p>

<p>Andria laughed as Beryl’s Andria had not known how.</p>

<p>“No!” she returned contemptuously. “Bermuda is a
lot of small islands; small and low, not high like this.
And it’s full of people—an English garrison and American
visitors. I knew a man who went there.”</p>

<p>Beryl’s eyes dilated like a cat’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“Then what’s this?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Andria, shrugging her shoulders.
“I haven’t enough geography.”</p>

<p>“Andria, you don’t believe he means to leave us here or
murder us,” said Beryl, with a queer calmness.</p>

<p>“The first, perhaps! Not the last, or he wouldn’t have
told Salome to take care of us.”</p>

<p>“Did he?”</p>

<p>Andria nodded. There was no need to say she was
sure he had not meant it.</p>

<p>“But there’s nothing to take care of us from!” continued
Beryl ungrammatically.</p>

<p>“He said there was. Oh, Beryl! I think and think, and
I can’t see daylight. Why he brought us, why he lied to
us; what it all means! He never saw me in his life, nor
heard of me, so it must be on your account. No one in
the convent ever knew who you were except Mother
Felicitas——”</p>

<p>“Did she?” asked Beryl sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes. But never mind her now, I only guessed that
she knew. Think if you can remember anything before
you ever came to the nuns.”</p>

<p>Beryl shook her head hopelessly.</p>

<p>“I’ve often tried. I can’t remember one thing but a
woman who used to hold me so tight and hard against
her that I cried. It seemed to be in a room with a queer
violet light in it—but it may be just a dream!”</p>

<p>“It’s no more useful.” Andria walked to the open
door and stood watching the sun dip into the bay they
had reached that morning; it lay empty now, blank, rose,
and opal under a gorgeous sky, but she was not thinking
of it. She was no girl like Beryl, but a woman, with a
woman’s sense of responsibility. Beryl was her charge,
she would take care of her—but how? That queer, blank
feeling of thoughts that would not come overpowered
her as it had the day she had learned she was not Andria
Erle, but only Andria Heathcote, dishonored and deserted.
A soft, heavy step made her start.</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, missus,” said Salome civilly, “but it’s
mighty nigh sundown, and I got to lock up dis place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Lock up now!” Andria’s gentle voice was even, as
usual. “Why, Salome?”</p>

<p>“It’s dark here, missus, de minute after de sun drops.
I always does like dis;” and she moved from jalousy to
jalousy, round the long veranda, drawing down and bolting
each stout wooden shutter with easy strength.</p>

<p>To the remonstrance of the new mistress she paid no
more attention than to a child’s; and, in truth, Andria
could not wish it. Since there was some danger, somewhere,
by all means let Salome bar it out! But she meant
to discover and fight it openly before long.</p>

<p>As the black woman barred the front door, Andria noticed
how strong it was, and how heavy. Was it to shut
in—or to shut out—that the bolts were so big!</p>

<p>“Where do you sleep, Salome?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“In de quarters behind de kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Out of the house, do you mean?” she asked, with an
uncontrollable start.</p>

<p>“Yes, missus, after de ladies’ dinner, at half-past seven,
Chloe an’ me an’ Amelia Jane goes to our own house.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t stay all alone, Salome! If we wanted
anything in the night——” said Andria, aghast now in
good earnest.</p>

<p>“De ladies ring de bell,” returned the woman anxiously.
“Dat’s de only way.”</p>

<p>“May I come and see? I’d like to.”</p>

<p>Salome chuckled. She led the way through what seemed
half a mile of empty rooms and disused pantries into the
kitchen; from its barred and grated window Andria saw
a paved courtyard, with a high wall on two sides, on the
third a stone house.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re not far! I could run to you.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t, missus! Ring de bell; we’ll do de running,”
said Salome anxiously.</p>

<p>“Then you’re not afraid to cross the courtyard in the
dark?” she asked, with sudden quickness.</p>

<p>Salome looked nervously at the courtyard wall.</p>

<p>“No, missus,” she answered. “Colored people ain’t got
time to be frightened o’ de dark.”</p>

<p>Andria remembered what the woman had said about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
her black skin protecting her. What could she have
meant?</p>

<p>By the time she was back in the drawing-room again
she saw Salome had been right about the darkness. It
had dropped on the world like a curtain the instant the
sun vanished.</p>

<p>There were no blinds to the windows, and in the lamplight
after dinner the dark squares of them were like blind
eyes. As the two lonely girls sat talking, each, without
telling the other, felt a growing dislike to those black
windows, through which the darkness of the shut-up
veranda showed like a solid wall. By degrees a curious
quietude fell on the two. How silent the house was, and
how silent the night outside.</p>

<p>“Andria,” said Beryl softly, “have the servants gone to
their funny little house? Who puts out these lights?”</p>

<p>“I do. We leave the hall lights burning, Salome said.”</p>

<p>Beryl gave a sudden shiver.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to bed! I don’t like it here in this room.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you? Why?”</p>

<p>The girl, with an infinitesimal movement of her finger,
pointed to the unblinded windows.</p>

<p>“Those!” she whispered. “I feel as if some one were
looking in.”</p>

<p>So did Andria. A dreadful feeling that they were
watched had come on her as they talked. Brave as she
was, she would have given a good deal to have had her
back to the wall instead of those windows, that might
suddenly splinter and crash in.</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense!” she said, more to herself than Beryl.
“The jalousies are shut; no one could see in.”</p>

<p>“They could—through the slats!”</p>

<p>“You goose, there isn’t any one within miles!” If Andria’s
quick laugh jarred a little, Beryl did not notice it
as the elder girl extinguished the lamps.</p>

<p>“Come along to bed—you’re getting nervous,” she commanded;
and purposely blundered against a chair in the
dark.</p>

<p>Once in her own room she put out the light there, and
knelt by the shut jalousies of the veranda—listening. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
had heard something down-stairs; had laughed that Beryl
might not hear it, too. Now, in the hush of the
veiled moonlight, she heard it still.</p>

<p>Some one was below her, in the garden, going round
and round the house with a fevered eagerness, almost
running. Holding her breath, she heard those quick,
quick steps, and her blood grew chill.</p>

<p>Who could be there?</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE PATTERING FOOTSTEPS.</p>


<p>In a less lonely place the governess would have thought
nothing of those footsteps, but here she had been expressly
told two things—there were no neighbors and there
was danger abroad at night.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I dare!” she thought, and peered through
the slats of the jalousy. The moon was on the other side
of the house; she could see that much, for this side was
in deep shadow. No one below could possibly see if a
jalousy were pushed out an inch or not. She unbolted the
smallest division of the heavy hanging shutters, and noiselessly
pushed it outward as far as she dared.</p>

<p>All she could see was the strip of garden and shrubbery
directly beneath her; darkly shadowed as it was she
could not tell if there was any one there.</p>

<p>“The night is dreadful in this place—dreadful!” she
thought. “There might be devils behind every bush. The
very moonlight is not like the good, clear light I know.
Mr. Egerton need not have warned me not to go out—nothing
would take me into those dreadful shadows,
that veiled, honey-colored light.”</p>

<p>The heavy jalousy tired her wrist, in another minute
she must let it go, and so far had learned nothing. She
had known down in the drawing-room that some person
or thing was outside. Nothing moved now in the stirless
garden—those strangely light, quick steps had ceased.
But out of the quiet another sound and a nearer smote
on her senses, a creaking as of wood rubbing on wood.</p>

<p>Her aching wrist forgotten, she peered through the
crack, and with horror, for the creepers were swaying
below her.</p>

<p>Some one was climbing up!</p>

<p>Somehow, she shut the jalousy, bolted it and got back
into her room. Something noiseless, light, a darker
shadow against the dark, clung for an instant to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
very shutter she had just closed, clung and was gone.
She heard the quick slither of it as it went down the
creepers, but whether it had been man or beast she could
not tell.</p>

<p>Her terror had taken her to the opposite wall of the
room, that she might at least have something solid behind
her back, and for a long minute she stood there,
sick with the horror of the thing.</p>

<p>Yet as she stood there, trembling-kneed, her heart grew
strangely light; she felt suddenly uplifted, happy, in the
midst of she knew not what mysterious dangers. Here
was the chance to do as Mother Benedicta, that saint on
earth, had bidden her long ago. To fight Beryl’s battles
bravely, and in doing it rub out, perhaps, those years
that had been so evil. For evil they had been; she had
never been sure as she pretended that Raimond Erle
and she were man and wife. She had snatched at happiness,
had cared little if that happiness were a sin, and
now——</p>

<p>“I have my chance to blot it out,” she said to herself
deliberately. “I’ll save the child if I have to die
for her. Perhaps Mother Benedicta’s saints won’t shut
me out of heaven then.”</p>

<p>The hope that had never yet left her, that Raimond
Erle might some day come back to her, ceased suddenly,
as her thoughts of revenging herself died in the new
hope that came over her.</p>

<p>“I’ll never see him again,” she thought, little knowing,
“and I’ll beat Mr. Egerton yet! A better woman
would have been a far more easily managed governess.
One like me knows too much. For I’m sure—sure
that he brought that girl here to put her out of the
way, and his warnings to Salome and me were nothing
but a blind.”</p>

<p>The danger she was in made her almost gay.</p>

<p>Quite boldly she stepped out on the veranda and looked
through those shutters where that strange, hunting thing
had scented her.</p>

<p>What was it? It had looked, with its spread-eagle
arms and legs, like an ape. She would find out in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
morning if there were such things here. Then she shuddered,
with a quailing at even her cold heart.</p>

<p>Salome had thanked Heaven she was black!</p>

<p>Then the thing, whatever it was, only attacked white
people. Could it be some dreadful, half-crazy black man,
run wild in the woods?</p>

<p>“I can’t get a pistol,” mused Andria dryly, “but I can
get a knife!” and she went quietly in to bed. The thing,
whatever it was, was gone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Bright and early she woke to a new day.</p>

<p>Amelia Jane, with a tea-tray, stood by her bed, and
Andria, after a dazed instant, remembered where she
was, and saw, too, that Amelia Jane looked tired. She
was the youngest of the colored women and the stupidest,
and she stared as she answered Andria’s good morning.</p>

<p>Fully dressed, she had lain down on her bed, her
only toilet for the night having been to take out the
pins from the great circle of ruddy hair that hung round
her in a glorious mass. Under the servant’s wondering
eyes, she laughed.</p>

<p>“I must have fallen asleep,” she said. “Don’t tell any
one, Amelia.”</p>

<p>“You wasn’t awake late, was you?” the woman returned
curiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I thought I heard footsteps, Amelia,
last night!”</p>

<p>Amelia Jane put down her tray.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of ’em—they isn’t lucky!” she said.
“They’s haunts, miss.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean ghosts?”</p>

<p>“Jus’ ghosts. My soul! I slep’ here in this house once.
I heard them steps all night. Hurry, hurry—hunt, hunt—but
I never see nothin’. Bermuda’s haunted, I tell
you so.”</p>

<p>“Is the house called Bermuda?” asked Andria quickly.</p>

<p>“Yas’m. And if it isn’t haunted, why is it that they’s
no footsteps heard out’n the quarters? Only in the big
house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>So the house was called Bermuda!</p>

<p>That was what Amelia had meant on the stairs.</p>

<p>Andria’s heart lightened a little, for at least it showed
the servants were not in league with Egerton to deceive
her.</p>

<p>“Nobody ever sees the ‘haunt,’ do they?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No’m! Sometimes ’taint here at all. Salome she say
it’s nonsense—but I don’t hear it. An’ yet it ain’t never
amounted to nothing, only jus’ noises.”</p>

<p>“Are there monkeys here, Amelia?”</p>

<p>Amelia Jane laughed till she had to cover her face
with her apron.</p>

<p>“Monkeys! No’m. I been here three years, an’ I
never hear tell of no monkeys. There ain’t no beasts
’tall. When you’ve had you bath’m kin I brush out your
hair? It’s tangled till if you piroots round in it you’ll
tear it out.”</p>

<p>Andria thanked her, her heart warming to the kindly
voice. But when her toilet was done and she stood,
fresh and fair, in front of the glass, some one knocked
at the door. It was Salome, and her fat face was anxious.</p>

<p>“Morning, missus,” she said hastily. “I come to tell
you little miss must habe gone out. I can’t see her
nowhere.”</p>

<p>“Out! Alone?” Andria gasped, “Oh, Salome! Which
way? Not down that path?”</p>

<p>“You clear out and look down de road, ‘Melia Jane!”
commanded the housekeeper, and stopped Andria, as
she would have followed.</p>

<p>“Don’t you say nothin’ of dat path to ‘Melia Jane,” she
whispered. “She’d be faint-hearted of de place ef she
got skeered. But run, missus, do; and get little miss.
She didn’t know no other way to go.”</p>

<p>“Then you heard—last night!” cried Andria, almost
running through the house, Salome at her heels.</p>

<p>“Heard what? Dey ain’t nothin’ to hear. Don’t you
listen to tales from ‘Melia Jane ’bout haunts. Dey’s fever
in dat path, dat’s all,” said the woman, lying obstinately.</p>

<p>Andria shot out of the house like an arrow from a bow.</p>

<p>Down that uncanny path, with its hot, strong scents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
and gaudy flowers, she ran as she had never thought
she could run; her skirts caught to her knees, she leaped
and stumbled and slid over the tangled vines and sharp
rocks. Suddenly a gleam of white caught her eyes,
and between two high rocks she saw Beryl, kneeling over
something on the ground.</p>

<p>“Beryl,” she screamed, hoarse with fear and anger at
the girl’s disobedience; “Beryl, why did you come here?
Come home!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said the girl softly, turning her head, “I’m
all right! Come here quietly and see what I’ve found.
Such a darling kitten!”</p>

<p>Andria, her pulses thumping and her breath gone,
caught back an angry word. What did the child mean?
She had noticed last evening that Salome had no dogs
or cats. And then her heart contracted.</p>

<p>On the ground beside Beryl, playing with her hand,
was a small cat—all marked with curious black rings
on its yellow-white coat.</p>

<p>But it was no cat. Its face was square, its eyes wild,
as it stopped its play at the sight of a second person.
Beryl, her own strange eyes intent and masterful, began
to stroke it with soft, strong fingers.</p>

<p>“Pussy, pussy—little, little cat!” she whispered in the
thing’s small ear; and as if it knew her it lay on its
back and patted her with velvet paws.</p>

<p>What she had seen in the night came back to the
governess. Had it been a full-grown thing like this that
had smelled her out on the upper veranda? Trembling,
she stepped to the girl’s side.</p>

<p>“Beryl, put it down! Come home,” she begged, for
orders, when the girl’s face was absent and obstinate,
were useless. “It may have its mother somewhere, you
don’t know! Come home.”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t hurt me!” said Beryl, and for a moment
those strange, yellow eyes met Andria’s, not so unlike the
eyes of the queer, wild kitten.</p>

<p>“No, but she might me,” said Andria quietly, as a forlorn
hope.</p>

<p>Beryl turned pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Andria, forgive me!” she cried. “I forgot.
There, little cat, run home! Or shall I take it with us
and feed it?”</p>

<p>“No, no! Oh, come away!” with a wild horror she
thought of being followed up the path by a prowling
thing like she had seen the night before. Almost she
stamped her foot as Beryl lingered, kissing her new-found
toy. Instead of scratching, it purred and rubbed its head
against her, and Andria knew that if she had touched
it the thing would have clawed her eyes out. Her heartbeats,
which had shaken her from breathlessness, shook
her now with terror. Who could tell what moment death
might not be on them?</p>

<p>But Beryl, putting down the kitten very gently, slipped
her arm through Andria’s with quick compunction.</p>

<p>“Come along,” she said sweetly. “I’d forgotten this
was a bad place and we weren’t to come here. Run
home, little cat! See, Andria, it will follow us!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Andria, with stiff lips. “It won’t come
far, I fancy.” She pushed Beryl in front of her so
that if more than the kitten should follow the girl would
have a chance to run, and found herself glancing every
which way just as Egerton had done the morning before.
To her despair Beryl turned suddenly off the path.</p>

<p>“Look!” she cried, “here’s the kitten again! It’s
caught up with us. And here’s the dearest little pond,
Andria!” She did not believe for one second in that
fairy-tale of the kitten’s mother. “See it—all white
sand, and so clear.”</p>

<p>Andria was utterly furious.</p>

<p>“Beryl, please come! I’m so hungry,” she said. “I
believe you want me to get fever.”</p>

<p>“How can you!” said Beryl. “You poor dear, I’ll
come now.”</p>

<p>And she did, hurrying with easy steps up the stony
path. The kitten stayed behind, and that terrified Andria
anew. She turned to follow Beryl, and her foot
slipped. For a moment she fell on her knees, faint with
pain; her face bent over the still water of the little
pond that mirrored her clearly. The next second her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
heart seemed to die in her. There was more than her
own face reflected in the water. Over her shoulder,
leering, mouthing as if it jabbered at her, was a second
face, so wild and dreadful that her throat grew shut
and dry with fear. With her newborn instinct of facing
an enemy, she wrenched herself round on her knees and
scrambled to her feet.</p>

<p>The space behind her was utterly empty! Even the
wild kitten was gone.</p>

<p>Not a rustle, a moving leaf, stirred the gorgeous shrubs
anywhere, and yet she knew some one had vanished into
them but now. That face that had leered at her from
the water mirror had been no dream, but a dreadful
reality.</p>

<p>“Reflection can’t lie,” she thought. “And I saw it
face to face with me.” She could scarcely move as she
realized how close it must have been to her to have peered
over her very shoulder.</p>

<p>“Beryl!” She suddenly remembered the girl she had
sworn to herself to take care of, and forgot her turned
ankle as she raced after her. At the end of the path
she almost sobbed with joy. There stood Beryl, fresh
and lovely in the sunshine that flooded the open turfed
lawns. Her face was quite careless and untroubled.</p>

<p>“I won’t tell her,” Andria thought swiftly. “She’s
seen nothing.” But even there in the open ground she
made her charge walk in front of her all the way to
the house, for fear of what might yet be behind them.</p>

<p>Salome stood waiting at the door, and turned away
as she saw them.</p>

<p>“What on earth’s the matter with Salome?” Beryl
said, laughing. “Andria, she was truly pale! She was
gray!”</p>

<p>But Andria said nothing.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE EYES OUTSIDE THE JALOUSY.</p>


<p>The weather changed that afternoon. A high, hot
wind blew from the southwest under a gray sky; the
sea thundered on the beach below the house; and as
Beryl looked out listlessly, rainlike waterspouts came
thrashing down.</p>

<p>“Hateful!” she said pettishly. “I was going out.”
Andria, whose bruised foot ached, began to laugh.</p>

<p>“You needn’t laugh! If you do I’ll go still,” she said,
with babyish wilfulness.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that,” said the so-called governess; “it’s
only this—do you know that we were supposed to do
lessons, and there isn’t a sign of a book in the house!
Not even a novel. Amelia Jane has half a Bible, and
she says that’s the only book there is.”</p>

<p>“I believe he’s just stuck us here to mold away and
die,” returned Beryl quite calmly. “He didn’t care
whether I learned anything or not, in spite of his grandfatherly
ways. But I’m not going to mold or die
either. I like the place!” she continued coolly. “I hope
he’ll never come back.”</p>

<p>“You won’t like it long,” muttered Andria to herself.
“You won’t have a chance,” for her adventures were
heavy on her mind, and it took all her will not to pour
them out to this careless listener.</p>

<p>“I like it out, I mean! I didn’t like it indoors much.”
Beryl went on, blessedly ignorant of the thoughts in her
companion’s mind. “That’s rather funny about the
books, but I don’t care. I wouldn’t do any more lessons
if we’d a library. All I want to do is to lie under the
trees and be lazy.”</p>

<p>“You need it, you poor baby,” said Andria pitifully.
For tall and strong as the girl was, she was too thin,
and the lovely outline of her pale, warm cheeks too
hollow. But in Andria’s mind was that there would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
be few days to be out of doors in sun or shade; if
things went on as now this house would not be their
prison alone—their only safety would be inside its stout
stone walls.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, here comes tea!” cried Beryl gaily. “Salome,
I haven’t anything to do, and it’s raining. Couldn’t
Amelia Jane go out and look for my cat?”</p>

<p>The tray clattered on the table. Salome had all but
dropped it.</p>

<p>“Cat?” she said. “Cat! Dey ain’t no cats here. For
the land’s sake, Miss Ber’l, what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just what I said,” answered Beryl provokingly.
“Why? Don’t you like cats, Salome?”</p>

<p>Salome opened her eyes till they looked all whites.</p>

<p>“Dey ain’t none on de island,” she persisted obstinately.
“What you mean? You didn’t bring no cat. I didn’t
see none.”</p>

<p>“I did, then, and I didn’t bring it either,” said Beryl,
with a cheerful laugh. “The dearest little cat, Salome!
I found it on the path on the shore this morning—all
yellow with black spots.”</p>

<p>“My gracious sakes, little miss!” said the woman
slowly, and Andria saw she was holding herself hard.
“Don’t you come and tell ole Salome dem tales.”</p>

<p>“She did find a cat, Salome!” Andria interrupted. “I
saw it, too. But it wasn’t like a common cat. I think
it was a wild one. Why didn’t you tell me there were
wildcats?”</p>

<p>The woman drew her breath so sharply that it was
all but a sob.</p>

<p>“Dey ain’t—no wildcats!” she returned faintly.</p>

<p>“I told you so, Andria,” Beryl stuck in gaily, helping
herself to tea. “I knew it was tame! It was so soft,
and had such sweet fur.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t go for to touch it?” and almost fiercely
Salome turned to the girl.</p>

<p>“Why not, if it was only a dream-cat, like you say?”
said Beryl, with that goblin look in her queer face. “Salome,
you silly woman, of course I did! I played with
it for ages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“An’ you never seen nothin’ else? Nothin’ ’tall?” she
insisted, her big chest heaving.</p>

<p>“No, of course not. Andria said its mother might
come and eat us, but she didn’t.”</p>

<p>Andria’s eyes, full of meaning, caught Salome’s from
behind Beryl’s shoulder. The colored woman read them
like print. If one had not seen, the other had—and
been silent. For an instant the black woman looked
rebelliously at the white. If the new red-haired mistress
meant there should be accidents Salome would
have no hand in them. She moved, stiff with angry suspicion,
to the front door.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll lock up now,” she muttered. “Don’t want
none o’ dem cats in my kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Salome, don’t shut up!” Beryl cried, running to the
nearest window. “My cat may be out there; wait till
I look. I’m going to bring the poor thing in out of
the rain if it’s there.”</p>

<p>She stared out into the blinding white mist of wild
and streaming rain. It was impossible to see through
it if there had been fifty cats; against it there was almost
no difference in color between the gray tree-trunks
and the green leaves, so blanched was the world. Suddenly
lightning passed before her eyes, short, white,
and vicious through the pearl-white rain, like a striking
sword. After it thunder that shook the very earth.
Under cover of the deafening peal of it Andria spoke
in Salome’s ear.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell her, don’t frighten her,” she whispered.
“You and I must take care of her. Oh, Salome, I saw
something!”</p>

<p>The woman’s face changed as if by magic. “I was
suspicioning you,” she said, banging the door. “I don’t
fancy dis place an’ dat’s a fact. But if you don’t, neither,
I guess we’ll get over dem—all o’ dem,” she laughed
savagely, but Andria caught at her black hand as at the
hand of a friend. “I trust you, Salome!” she breathed.</p>

<p>“Fo’ the Lawd, you kin,” said the woman shortly.
“But dey ain’t no time now. You wait, missus, till to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” shrieked Beryl. “There’s my cat. I saw it.
It’s looking for me. I’ll get it.”</p>

<p>Salome, with a bound that was ludicrous in a stout
person who shook as she walked, caught the girl half
out of the window. “Does you want to get killed by
dat lightning?” she cried authoritatively. “I tell you
dey ain’t no playing wid de sword of de Lawd in dis
country. See dat!” she cried sharply.</p>

<p>A tall tree was struck as she spoke, and the thunder
drowned the fall of it, as the rain quenched its smoking
limbs. “Dey ain’t no cats worf frizzling for, I tell
you.”</p>

<p>To Andria’s surprise Beryl turned obediently from
the window. Salome, with feverish haste, shut up her
fortress and lit the lamps.</p>

<p>“Dey’ll be good men drowned in dat wind,” she said
soberly. “You pray for dem, Miss Ber’l, instead o’ chasing
after no cats.”</p>

<p>A sudden heavy gust against the house corroborated
her. The wind would be a hurricane by and by. In
the noise of it the woman muttered to herself despairingly.
“She see dat cat in daylight—broad daylight.
Oh! my soul—and dey’ll be wind to-night. I dunno
what I’m gwine do. I daresn’t tell ’em; he’d murder
me just like dat if I did. I got to piroot some way out
of it.” And she shook her head meaningly as Andria
would have followed her from the room.</p>

<p>Chloe and Amelia Jane waited at dinner. Salome was
absent doing other things. Strange things enough in
that lonely place, far from towns and tramps. The
woman was strong as a man, and she worked feverishly
at her self-appointed task; piled packing-cases before
the doors opening on the lower veranda, put heaps of
some strange-smelling, dried herb on the verandas themselves.
The top ones she never thought of, knowing
nothing of Andria’s vision the night before. When she
had finished her poor precautions she regarded them
doubtfully enough.</p>

<p>“Broad daylight, and I’d been sure dey was clean
gone,” she groaned. “And here it’s night, and de wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
risin’. Pray dey’s grit in ole Salome yet! But I ain’t
knowing just what to do. Dey tells me red-haired white
women is liars, and how do I know ’bout dis one! She
kin trust me sure enough, but I ain’t trying no speriments
on her.”</p>

<p>Yet that very wind that was racking Salome’s nerves
had set Andria’s at rest. There could be no prowling
spies on a night like this; not even that strange being,
whose leering, mocking face she scarcely dared remember,
could be abroad in such a storm. The face had been
barely human; animal greed and hatred had been in it,
hungry fierceness in its glittering eyes as it grinned at
her. She longed to go and pour out her story to Salome,
but when she looked into the kitchen all was
darkness.</p>

<p>“Salome needn’t have deserted us!” she thought, like
a hurt child, and then resolutely banished all fear of
their great loneliness in the inclemency of the night.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Beryl, as Andria returned to the
drawing-room. “See what I’ve found. Isn’t it fun?”</p>

<p>She had from somewhere unearthed a long ugly dagger,
very fine and sharp. On the floor she had put
a row of oranges, and with unerring aim was throwing
the dagger at them. She never missed; each orange
as it was struck was nailed to the floor. Andria took
the dagger from the orange where it stood quivering.
How sharp it was! She had fairly to drag it from the
polished board.</p>

<p>“Let me try!” and to her surprise, after the first failure,
the thing was easy. Only the fear of breaking the
new toy made her stop; she might have need of it.</p>

<p>“I found some cards, too, and a book!” Beryl cried.
“Such a funny old book. Listen!” She read aloud
from a battered calf octavo: “‘As sure as the turquoise
brings love and the amethyst repels it, so does the opal
attract misfortune and the beryl bring bad dreams.’
There, the beryl’s me! What kind of a stone is it? I
never saw one.”</p>

<p>“It’s green,” said Andria absently; “pale-green; something
the color of that wild kitten’s eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“Then look here!” exclaimed Beryl excitedly. “Is this
one? It was shut up in the book. Trust me to rummage
round and find things.”</p>

<p>She held up a tarnished gold ring, thin and old, set
with a pale-green stone that glittered in the lamplight.</p>

<p>Andria seized it.</p>

<p>“It’s a beryl, certainly,” she said slowly. “I wonder
whose it is!”</p>

<p>“It’s mine now,” said Beryl, snatching it and slipping
it on her finger. “I’m going to wear it.”</p>

<p>“Bad dreams, the book says, and you’ve no right to it,
you know,” said Andria.</p>

<p>“Neither has old Egerton any right to me. I’ll bring
him bad dreams, too, if I can. Oh, Andria! Isn’t it
pretty? I never wore a ring in my life.”</p>

<p>Andria looked silently at her own bare fingers where
once the diamonds had felt heavy. “They didn’t bring
happiness,” she said softly. “But you can wear it if
you like. Where are the cards? I’ll teach you to play
euchre.”</p>

<p>Curiously enough, all Beryl’s nervousness of the night
before had vanished. She sat down calmly with her
back to the uncurtained windows and bestowed her
whole attention on the game. Her left hand, with the
cards in it, was held high, with the ring glittering on
it, so that if there had been any one to look in they
could have seen it plainly. The storm made the house
shake, solid as it was, and the noise of it was deafening.
There could be no one abroad to-night, yet suddenly
Andria seemed to stiffen in her chair.</p>

<p>“Beryl,” she whispered, putting down a card that was
all wrong, “there’s the queerest sound in the wind! Like
something sniffing at the door. Can’t you hear it?”</p>

<p>“I heard it ages ago,” said Beryl gaily. “Perhaps
it’s my cat. Shall I let it in?”</p>

<p>“No! Don’t move. It’s too loud; no kitten could
make it. It sounds like a horse sniffing dust and blowing
it out again.”</p>

<p>The girl listened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Very, very soft, in the battering wind, came another
sound; a scratch, scratch, scratch at the door.</p>

<p>“It is my kitten! I”—with a curious look in her eyes
Beryl had risen—“I must go.”</p>

<p>“You sha’n’t stir,” said Andria, with a sudden ugly
gentleness. “You don’t know what’s outside. Come
up-stairs; it isn’t safe here.” She caught Beryl’s arm
and fairly pushed her from the room, catching up that
lean, sharp dagger as she passed it. The instant they
were over the threshold the scratching ceased, as if whatever
was outside knew they had gone.</p>

<p>Half-way up-stairs a sudden crash as if some one had
upset a heavy table stopped both girls short. Fear
caught Andria by the throat; silent and dry-lipped she
pushed Beryl against the wall and stood in front of her,
the dagger in her hand. Had something got in up-stairs?
Was she to fight for both their lives—now—on these
stairs? The next second she heard Salome’s voice: “Ladies,
ladies,” she called frantically, “come up out o’ dat.
Oh, my soul! Dey’s smelled de white blood—de white
blood!”</p>

<p>“Salome! I thought you’d gone to your own house.
What is it?—there’s something—outside at the door.”</p>

<p>“Come up, come up!” The black woman ran down
to them, her snowy turban askew on her frizzy hair. “Oh,
Miss Holbeach, I been here six years and I never seen
nothin’ like dis. Dey’s hunted you down, hunted——”
her voice broke horribly.</p>

<p>“What?” said Beryl sharply. She broke from Andria’s
hands and ran up-stairs.</p>

<p>Andria tore after her, and stopped short at what she
saw.</p>

<p>Beryl was out on the veranda, staring into the darkness.
Opposite her, not two yards from her face, something
shone through the bar of the jalousies. Two
great eyes, green as the stone she had found, glittering,
ravenous, were fixed on her; but not even a shadow
of the thing in whose head they shone showed against
the black storm outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“Come in,” said Andria, paralyzed. “Come in! Oh,
what is it?”</p>

<p>At the sound of her voice there came a snarl that
made her blood cold, but the creature, whatever it was,
could not loose its foothold to claw at the bars.</p>

<p>“It’s an animal,” said Beryl, in a queer singsong tone,
“I’m not afraid of animals. Go in, or you’ll be killed.”</p>

<p>She walked nearer to those awful eyes, crooning softly
to herself. The snarling ceased, but as Andria, in mad
fear, leapt after the girl, it broke out so wildly, with
such a guttural note of rage, that she screamed. The
thing had got foothold! It was clawing at the bars.</p>

<p class="center">A STRANGE POWER.</p>


<p>With a quick, backward sweep of her long, young
arm Beryl Corselas sent Andria staggering backward,
but she never looked to see Salome catch her dexterously
and drag her inside the room.</p>

<p>Without taking her eyes from the fierce ones outside
the stout, wooden shutters, the girl began to croon again
and the hungry scratching of the iron claws ceased.
Monotonous, scarcely rising or falling, that queer chant
went on, till through it there rose a purr like a great cat’s.</p>

<p>Closer, closer Beryl drew to the jalousy; the horrified
watchers saw her all but touch it. She stopped
and gazed through the slats, straight into the wonderful
eyes. Very slowly the great animal relaxed, scraping
against the wood. Something heavy, yet strangely light-footed,
leaped softly to the ground. The thing was
gone.</p>

<p>Exactly as if she walked in her sleep Beryl Corselas
came straight to the other two.</p>

<p>“I want a drink of water,” she said, very low. “That
was a jaguar.”</p>

<p>Salome struck a light and shut the door on the awful
darkness of the veranda before she brought a tumbler
from the wash-stand.</p>

<p>“How do you know? You never saw one.” Andria’s
voice was thick with shame. She had been so grand
about saving Beryl; and it was Beryl who had saved
her! She threw her dagger down angrily; it would
have been no use at all in a struggle with a beast like
that.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Beryl gulped at the water. “But
I do know, somehow,” she said in her natural, every-day
voice.</p>

<p>Salome took the tumbler from her with a curious
gesture of respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“My soul! You saved us! Oh! my glory!” she
cried hysterically. “Glory, glory!” her voice rang out
between sobs and laughter. “You’s one o’ dem.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Andria had played a small
part and hated herself.</p>

<p>“You knows much as I knows,” said Salome sullenly.
“You seen! She was de beat of ’em. Dey’s some born
like dat. Oh, missy, glory be dis night!” Her chest
heaved as she turned to Beryl, but the girl only walked
away.</p>

<p>“Salome,” Andria broke out angrily, “you don’t trust
me! I tell you I love the child. I have nothing to do
with Mr. Egerton’s plots against her. I’ve known her
ever since she was a baby.”</p>

<p>“Don’t never hear o’ no plots,” said Salome sharply.
But at the look on Andria’s face she buried her own
in her hands. “I will trust you, missus,” she whispered.
“Fo’ de Lawd, ole Salome couldn’t tell ’bout you. I’m
sick o’ dis life and dis yer place, dat’s true.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me what it all means,” commanded Andria
sternly. “Why are we besieged here every night
by wild beasts and worse?”</p>

<p>Salome caught her by the arm.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she cried. “I can’t tell you nothin’. I took
my Bible oath”—on Amelia Jane’s poor relic of religion!—“to
hole my tongue. But I took another in my mind
to take care of dat child.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me who I saw last night!” said Andria
frantically. “Whose hateful face jabbered at me this
morning, down the path——”</p>

<p>“You done see him! My soul!” said the woman, as
if hell had opened under her feet. “Den we’s gone,
sure enough. Dey’s more than jaguars.”</p>

<p>Beryl, as if she listened to something very far off,
had drawn to the other end of the room. She stood,
a tense white figure, deaf to all other sounds but those.
Andria pointed to her dumbly.</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything,” she breathed. “She is afraid
of people, never of animals. At the convent she once
saved a sister from an ox that turned on her——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“Dey’s born so, I tell you,” Salome returned, with a
kind of pride.</p>

<p>“Salome, if you don’t speak out to me I’ll go mad,”
Andria said desperately. “What can I do if I don’t
know what it all means?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you nothin’,” answered Salome slowly. “I
couldn’t get clear if I did. And you knows all I knows
now. I don’t know no more. Black people in the house,
no one comes—white women! You seen to-night.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the place is safe for black people?”</p>

<p>“De white blood draws ’em,” she answered in a
whisper that thrilled.</p>

<p>“But men; Mr. Egerton——”</p>

<p>“When he comes back you see. He ain’t going to
stay long. He sleep up, up in de roof, last time he
come.”</p>

<p>“And he brought two women here!” Every drop of
Andria’s blood recoiled.</p>

<p>“Dat’s what I can’t understand,” said Salome eagerly.
“He say, ‘Salome, you take care on ’em!’ And I seem
to feel he don’t mean it.”</p>

<p>“He can’t,” said Andria simply. “Oh! Salome, can’t
we get away? Isn’t there any one on all this island
but us? Isn’t there a village—boats?”</p>

<p>“If dey is dey’s behind miles o’ bush and scrub dat
we can’t scrape through,” Salome returned, very low.
“Boats, if you means getting away by de sea, dey ain’t
none, ’less we make ’em. I never see no living soul
since I been here—but what you see to-night!”</p>

<p>“But why are you here?”</p>

<p>“’Cause he brought me. He tell me he take me to
good place in Bermuda, and I came here. Oh, missus!
I’m not old—but I’m wore out with misery.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not a slave! Why did you stay?”</p>

<p>“Niggers has no choice,” she answered darkly. And
something told Andria there was a black story that Salome
would not tell. “By and by he bring Chloe an’
Amelia Jane. He tell dem dis is Bermuda. And dey
never fret, dey only caring to eat and save deir wages.
De Lawd knows if we ever get away from here. Don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
you ’spose I never tried, ’cause dat’s what I did try. But—I
ain’t gone yet!”</p>

<p>“I’ll make him let us go!”</p>

<p>Salome clutched her, really ashy with terror.</p>

<p>“You never say nothin’, or dey’s no more o’ dis world
for me. You mind now. I never tell you nothin’; you
never tell me nothin’; you see and I sees; and we beat
them if we can. Dey’s here, dey’s always been here,
but when dey ain’t no one but niggers in de house dey
goes. Dey get master yet,” she said savagely, “for all
he dares ’em.”</p>

<p>“But you told me there were no animals—where did
that thing come from?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think dey spring out o’ de earth. I
don’t know. But dey’s worse—you tell me he jabbers
at you dis morning,” interrupting herself, “an’ she’s
afraid of people! If he’s going round in de daylight
like dat, an’ she’s afraid, he’ll get her sure!”</p>

<p>“But who is he?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s what I don’t know. But he climbs and—Miss
Holbeach, it ain’t no jaguar dat chokes de life out o’
my lambs and don’t tear no flesh nor skin!”</p>

<p>Andria’s flesh crawled at the slow words. In the
silence the storm outside was like the end of the world.
The battering of the wind, the crash of falling trees, the
roar of the rain covered the low voices of the two women.
In the uproar Beryl, like a statue that lived and listened,
drew her breath long and slow. Suddenly she spoke,
without turning.</p>

<p>“There are more than that one, and they’re hunting
and yapping like dogs. I wish I could see them! But
it’s too dark.”</p>

<p>“Are they hunting us?” cried Andria, shuddering. Already
she seemed to feel the ripping claws, the crunching
teeth of the great beast outside.</p>

<p>“Not me!” said Beryl dreamily.</p>

<p>Salome watched her with awestruck eyes.</p>

<p>“If we dies, we dies,” she said hardly. “Better lie
down on dem beds an’ rest. Dey ain’t got in yet. Pray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
de Lawd we ain’t going to be de meat at a jaguar
wedding dis night!”</p>

<p>With the stoical courage born of long endurance of
fear she lay down on a rug. Andria, in sheer despair,
sat down silently. And in the midst of the storm she
seemed to hear what Beryl was hearing—a wild snarling,
a medley of quick cries—and set her teeth. Any
minute, through any door, a square, savage head might
show itself with death in its green eyes. She looked at
Beryl.</p>

<p>The girl was curled up on her bed like a kitten, sound
asleep.</p>

<p>Black woman and white looked at each other, then
with one consent sat up and kept their useless, terrified
watch till the lamp burned dim. The wind had fallen,
the horrid outcry in the garden had ceased, and, lulled
by the quiet, the two slept in their chairs, worn out.</p>

<p>As the dawn flushed in the east the girl on the bed
sat up, looked at the two weary figures, the dying lamp,
and like a ghost stole by them. When the clear sunlight
at last roused them she had not come back.</p>

<p>Scorching morning sun on a barren point of rock and
sand, and on great waves that thudded and broke emerald-green
and white on the wet beach; and nothing else
to tell of the past night’s storm.</p>

<p>Nothing, unless if any one had shaded their eyes to
gaze at the beach, where the hot air quivered, they
might have seen a huddled thing lying there just out
of the reach of the waves; a thing that last night had
been a man, and to-day—motionless, lax, it seemed but
the body that some one had cast aside. If something
did move in the bushes, it did not disturb that quiet
sleeper in the sun.</p>

<p>“Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn
in no other.”</p>

<p>Brian Heriot had been put into the Guards at twenty,
had lived as gaily as if money grew on every bush, till
the crash came and undeceived him. His father died
without a will, and his elder brothers quietly threw him
over. The new Lord Heriot was a Plymouth brother and
a philanthropist; he had no money to waste on idle young
butterflies in the Guards. The Honorable Brian Heriot
grinned without much mirth when he realized his position.
He disgusted his dear friends by calmly taking
what little money he had to pay his debts, and then,
without a word to any one, quietly “went under.” His
old haunts knew him no more; people forgot him, no
one troubling to remember that if Lord Heriot was a
pious prig, Brian, his brother, was a born adventurer.</p>

<p>Strange lands, strange occupations knew him. He
grew very tanned, very handsome, with a look in his
face that made women turn their heads as he passed.
But he made no money, only kept body and soul together;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
a rolling stone that yet did not go down-hill. For he
kept his soft speech and manner, his good heart that
hated cruelty and a lie. Somehow he had drifted to
Fayal, and there being penniless, if cheerful, had shipped
on a small coasting-vessel that gathered cargo for the
European steamers.</p>

<p>That was a week ago. This morning there was neither
vessel, cargo, nor crew; nothing but Brian Heriot washed
ashore almost dead. He had swum till he could swim
no more; that was all he knew. That, and a great
crashing of water, and utter darkness. But the very
wave that had stunned him had cast him high and dry
like a bit of driftwood on the sandy point where he
lay.</p>

<p>As the sun warmed him he stirred, ever so faintly.</p>

<p>Had something touched him? Stooped over him with
clammy fingers on his bare throat? He tried to open
his eyes, but he saw only one fleeting shimmer of sun
on water before they closed again. There was a deadly
heaviness in his limbs, an utter indifference in his brain;
he did not know whether he was alive or dead, and did
not care. Presently he knew he was dreaming.</p>

<p>He thought he was lying in hot, hot sun, on hotter
sand, and turned away from the hungry sea that pounded
in his ears. And just before his eyes stood a girl; a
tall girl in white, with a great veil of dusky hair streaming
over her. Round her feet played two jaguar cubs,
and in her arms was a third, that she cuddled and
crooned to as if it were a child. Step by step she came
close to him, and over her shoulder there peered from
the bushes another face that leered and laughed as if
in malice. A dreadful fright for the girl came over
Brian Heriot, but in his nightmare he could not stir.
He tried to shout, and the dream went. Something wet
and cool on his head roused him; a shadow that was
heaven came between him and the sun; a girl’s voice
scolded something that seemed to be running and jumping
over him.</p>

<p>With an effort that racked every bone Brian Heriot
sat up, and stared about him. Half his dream was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
true. He was on a beach, a wet handkerchief was bound
on his head, but there was no one there.</p>

<p>“Please come back!” he said. “I won’t hurt you,”
and then laughed ruefully. Sick and dizzy, with a cut
head and a wrenched ankle, he certainly would not hurt
any one. “Oh, do come back!” he cried again, with a
kind of vexed impatience, and wished he could remember
some Portuguese instead of this useless English.</p>

<p>But even as he spoke the bushes parted, and a girl
slipped out of them. She stood looking at him with great
eyes almost as yellow as topaz, and he saw the color
come and go in her creamy cheeks.</p>

<p>“I thought you were Mr. Egerton at first,” she said
slowly, almost sullenly. “Did you come with him? Is
he back?”</p>

<p>Ill and exhausted as he was, the incongruity of the
thing made him stare. Where had he got to, that a
girl played with jaguar cubs and spoke in English?</p>

<p>“I don’t know any one named Egerton,” he said, propping
himself up on one arm. “My name’s Heriot.”</p>

<p>“How did you get here? You really mean you don’t
know him?”</p>

<p>“I mean I never heard of him,” he answered stupidly.
“I got here because my ship was wrecked last night. If
you hadn’t waked me I think I should have had a touch
of sun.”</p>

<p>“You must get out of it,” said the girl quickly. She
twisted her hair into a knot, as if she had just remembered
it. As she did so a ring on her finger glittered
green, and at the sight of it something in the bushes
drew back sharply.</p>

<p>At the rustle she bounded like a frightened child closer
to the man in the sand, whose eyes were so blue in his
handsome face, handsome in spite of blood-stains.</p>

<p>“Did you see anything besides me, a little while ago?”
she whispered. “Quick, tell me!”</p>

<p>“I thought I saw a man,” he answered, surprised. “But
I wasn’t myself; I don’t know.”</p>

<p>She put her hand on his shoulder, and to his amaze
he felt it tremble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“So did I!” she whispered, lower still. “Get up. I’ll
help you. I’ll take you with me. But,” suspiciously,
“you mean what you say? Mr. Egerton didn’t send
you?”</p>

<p>“No one sent me.” He forgot she was a girl, and
spoke with rough truth as to a man. “God knows you
haven’t much choice when you’re washed overboard. I
didn’t mean to come. Why should I lie about it?”</p>

<p>“Most people,” she said composedly, “lie. But”—she
stopped, listened—“come, come away!” she cried. “I’m
afraid here.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be afraid of much,” he answered, full of
wonder. “I saw you playing with jaguar cubs just now,
unless I dreamed it.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed. That rough denial of Egerton had
somehow made her trust the man. “Those were my
cats. I’m not afraid of animals. I hate people, though,
except Andria.”</p>

<p>“By George!” thought Heriot, “I’d rather face ten
men than one jaguar. Who is the girl? And who’s
Andria? I knew one Andria, but——” He smiled at
the idea; it could not be she!</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything about animals.” She had
read his face with a queer anger. Turning from him,
she began to croon, very low, and at a call a yellow,
white, black-spotted kitten came out of the bushes. But
it only rubbed against her skirt and bounded away. Beryl
Corselas grew pale.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said, and took his hand. “Can you walk?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” He got on his feet and gritted his teeth with
the pain in his ankle. “Is it far?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I don’t know,” she said absently, staring round
her. Who was calling the cats that they would not
stay with her? What horrible face had she seen for
one instant through the bushes? “Don’t let go my
hand!” she said suddenly, childishly; and Heriot, for all
his pain, saw that this girl who played with jaguars was
frightened.</p>

<p>But as he went with her up what was surely a path,
though not worn by shod feet, the feeling that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
all a dream came over him again. If it had not been
for the pain in his foot he might have been Adam
walking with Eve in Eden for the loneliness and the
beauty of the place. The wet scrub was a mass of
flowers, gorgeous butterflies swam through thickets of
white and rose heaths, strange blossoms flaunted in his
face. And never in all his days had he seen a beauty
so strange as that of the girl who led him by the hand.
Yet for all its unlined youth the face was pathetic,
tragic; the dull rose lips were lips that had tasted
grief.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by saying you’re afraid of people?”
he said, the pain in his ankle making him talk, for fear
he should groan.</p>

<p>“Animals are simple; I understand them,” she returned,
without slackening her pace. “People all have an animal
in them. I see it in their faces, but an animal turned
bad. Mother Felicitas was a white wolf.”</p>

<p>“You are not afraid of me?” He was afraid himself
of her answer.</p>

<p>“No!” she answered carelessly. “No more than I
would be of a dog. Come on!”</p>

<p>Heriot had stopped. He leaned against a tree, faint
with pain. He would cheerfully have given a thousand
pounds for a drink.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait,” he said ruefully. “I mean I
will. There’s something wrong with my foot.”</p>

<p>With feverish haste the girl picked up a stick that
lay on the path and shoved it into his hand. “It’s green,
it won’t break. Use it for a walking-stick,” she ordered.
“And try to hurry. Don’t you know there’s
something following us?”</p>

<p>He had not heard a sound.</p>

<p>“What sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“Something dumb,” she whispered, “that leers and
jabbers, and I can’t manage it, for I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>Heriot put his hand in his trousers pocket. His pistol
was gone.</p>

<p>“Walk ahead,” he said, setting his teeth. And as
she obeyed he heard behind him a faint rustling that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
grew no nearer. He limped on in purgatory from the
heat and his foot. His head swam as the sweat poured
off him. If it had not been for the terror of the girl
with him he would have sat down and waited for what
was following them rather than have walked another
step.</p>

<p>Suddenly she cried out, and, reaching back for his
hand, fairly dragged him after her. They were out of
the scrub, standing at the edge of a great, open meadow,
with trees scattered over it. As in a dream he saw a
white house, quite near; nearer still a black woman and
a white running to them. He was so dizzy that he
reeled and nearly pulled the girl backward as she clutched
his hand.</p>

<p>“Beryl!” cried a voice high and sweet. “Oh, Beryl,
where have you been—who’s that?” asked Andria, with
a quick note of startled surprise.</p>

<p>The whole world swam before Mr. Heriot’s eyes. He
tried to steady himself, to speak.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Erle,” he began, quite calmly, and fainted dead
away on the grass at Andria’s feet.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">OLD SINS AWAKENED.</p>


<p>Andria’s heart contracted where she sat in the pleasant,
green-shaded room. The three colored women had
made nothing of carrying the unconscious man into an
unused room in the upper story of the servants’ quarters;
Salome’s eyes had told Andria he must not be taken into
the big house. And there in the spotless bareness of the
darkened chamber Andria had sat ever since, like a
woman who sees a ghost, waiting for this man who
knew her to come to his senses.</p>

<p>For he knew her quite well. He had been a friend of
Raimond Erle’s, had believed like the rest of London that
the woman who was called “the lovely Andria” had been
the true cause of his financial ruin. When he found
what she was doing here, would he warn Beryl what a
wicked woman she was who masqueraded as a governess
and guardian?</p>

<p>She lifted her bowed head to look at him, and saw he
had wakened from the heavy sleep that had come on
him after his fainting-fit.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Erle,” he said again stupidly.</p>

<p>She walked over to him swiftly.</p>

<p>“I’m not Mrs. Erle; I never was!” she said, with a
kind of passion. “My name is Andria Heathcote, but
they call me Holbeach here.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“I know,” she cut him short. “I have begun again.
I am Beryl’s governess, the girl who brought you home.
She knows my real name, but I told her I called myself
Holbeach for reasons of my own.”</p>

<p>“Governess!” he said, staring.</p>

<p>“I’m not fit, you think!” she said bitterly.</p>

<p>“I would not say so,” said the man slowly, and the
blood came to his face.</p>

<p>“You think I’m bad—an—adventuress——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“I think you ruined Raimond Erle,” he answered
bluntly.</p>

<p>With a queer gesture she put her hand to her heart
as if it hurt her. This man was of the world, would
judge as the world; and he could tell.</p>

<p>“I——” She could not finish. A man who did not
know her would have been a rock of defense, to whom
she could have told everything. This man would never
believe she was not in Egerton’s pay, to get rid of Beryl
Corselas. He would remember the evil places, the evil
company he had seen her in; would think it right to destroy
Beryl’s faith in the only soul she trusted.</p>

<p>No! Let him think this was an ordinary house, she
masquerading as an ordinary governess. Salome said it
would be weeks before he could walk; let him stay here
in this secluded room, where no noises would wake him.
He was only another burden, not a help.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot,” she said quietly, “you will do as you
like, of course, about airing what you know of me. But
if you will wait you will see perhaps that I’m not all bad—not
what you may think. Don’t tell Beryl that I was
Andria Erle till you see reason to mistrust me,” and even
while she spoke she knew he would see reason enough
as soon as Beryl’s careless, indifferent tongue told the
queer story of Egerton and the happenings in this evil
house. No sane person would believe that if such things
were possible in this every-day world the woman Egerton
paid was not on his side in them. And what Egerton’s
side was did not puzzle Andria, if it did Salome.</p>

<p>“I don’t go about blackmailing people,” said Heriot
coldly. “Don’t look so nervous.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t think I ought to be in the house with
any girl,” she said quietly, and he could not see the bitterness
in her face.</p>

<p>“If you ask me,” unwillingly, “no! But God knows I
can’t throw the first stone at you, especially when you
take me in and nurse me,” but the old dislike of her and
her kind was in his voice as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Then try and think kindly of me,” she broke out,
and there were tears in the eyes he had always seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
so hard. “I have begun again; I’ve put all that behind
me.” With a gesture of loathing he understood.</p>

<p>“My dear lady,” he returned quickly, “don’t plead like
that! It is no business of mine what you were. I see
you here as Miss Holbeach, and—as for the girl, I am
not her keeper.”</p>

<p>“No, but I am!” she retorted, for his tone hurt unbearably.
“And keep her I will. I will send your dinner
now,” she said, with a change of manner that said
more for her self-control than her honesty; “it is nearly
six o’clock; you must be starving.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said Heriot quickly, “who is the child?
What did she mean this morning by saying she was
frightened?”</p>

<p>He was not prepared for the look on Mrs. Erle’s face.</p>

<p>“Frightened!” she stammered. “What of—did she
say? Not of those horrible cats?”</p>

<p>“If you mean jaguar cubs, she was playing with them.
No; some one dumb, she said, who leered and mouthed
at her—and I thought I saw a queer face myself, too!”</p>

<p>Involuntarily Andria did the worst thing possible.</p>

<p>“You were hurt and half-senseless,” she returned
coolly. “You imagined you saw what the child romanced
about.”</p>

<p>But he had seen her dismayed and confounded face,
and knew she lied.</p>

<p>“That woman here!” he thought, as she left the room,
shutting his eyes and seeing her as he had seen her in
Raimond Erle’s house, covered with diamonds, surrounded
by the worst men in town. “And with that innocent,
fairy-tale sort of child and her queer pets. Why
did she lie to me just now? And why are either of them
here? This must be Flores or Corvo; one of the Azores,
anyhow! And what is she about to let things frighten
the girl?”</p>

<p>The whole thing made him thoughtful. Were there
only the governess and the girl—where were the master
and mistress? Intuitively the man felt there was something
wrong. With a resistless impulse to see at least
where he was, he managed to drag himself over to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
window. Through the half-open jalousy he saw a small,
stone courtyard, strong as a prison, shaded by a high
building from the sinking sun. And as he stared voices
floated up to him.</p>

<p>“Salome, she saw—you know something that jabbered
at her! She told him. What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Why’d she tell him?” The second voice was richer,
more guttural. “Oh, my glory, missus! Mr. Egerton——”
and the rest was in a whisper.</p>

<p>“I know. This man won’t help us, Salome!”</p>

<p>“No! An’ if Mr. Egerton he come back and find him
here, de onliest thing dat’ll happen is de Death Trap.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” But the voice was not surprised,
only appalled.</p>

<p>“Pray he don’t find out. Best keep Miss Ber’l away
from him. If she tells him things, an’ he sees—he’ll go
out fur to fight! And you knows, missus,” earnestly,
“he might have friends. Dey’d be coming round asking
for him. Onless you kin trust him to help us?” with a
searching accent that was an entreaty.</p>

<p>“He’ll never help us. He’ll be against us, not for us,”
bitterly. “You daren’t tell, Salome?”</p>

<p>“Den if he won’t help us, de sooner he goes de better.
I can’t tell. Ain’t nothin’ to me, one white man!
An’ if Mr. Egerton finds people spyin’ round here, it’s de
end of me, sure!”</p>

<p>“He can’t hear anything up there?”</p>

<p>“No! No more’n ’Melia Jane does. Onless little miss
screams!”</p>

<p>“She sha’n’t scream!”</p>

<p>Heriot drew away from the window, but not so far
that he did not see Andria Erle cross the courtyard with
a light, quick step that went ill with the grim sound in
her voice.</p>

<p class="center">DOUBTING THOMAS.</p>


<p>Mr. Heriot, to his disgust, was extremely ill after that
rash journey to the window.</p>

<p>For a fortnight he had fever, and was nursed untiringly
by Salome, silent as a statue. When he had
mended enough to be left alone and could walk about his
room, he discovered he was to all intents a prisoner.
His stout nurse had calmly locked the door on him to
keep him out of mischief.</p>

<p>“Serves me right for spying on them!” he thought,
ashamed and angry, standing at the window, as he had
done that first evening. “But, all the same, I think
there’s some devilment going on here—hello!” he pushed
the jalousy from him and leaned out.</p>

<p>Beryl Corselas, idle and listless, stood in the courtyard
alone. He had never seen her since she had brought him
from the shore, and her beauty, that was so young and
so pathetic, struck him afresh.</p>

<p>“Are you better?” she cried, waving her hand to him.
“Why don’t you come out?”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” he answered calmly. “Salome has locked
me in.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” said the girl promptly. She ran across the
yard, and he heard her light feet on the stair outside.</p>

<p>“You were locked in!” she cried, opening the door
and standing there, tall and lovely, her dark hair no
longer hanging round her and her white dress immaculate,
instead of being soaked with dew. “How funny!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” returned Heriot gravely. He led the way
out, limping; he had no notion that Mrs. Erle should find
her charge in his room.</p>

<p>“Everything’s funny here, though,” the girl said
thoughtfully. “I’m getting used to it. But even Andria
has got queer since you came. She just sits and thinks,
and she won’t let me out of her sight. She has a headache<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
to-day, poor Andria! And Salome and the others
are busy washing. This is the way, out this door.”</p>

<p>She led him into the house through the empty kitchen,
and at the voices, and laughter that came from the wash-tubs
the man felt he must be a fool with his suspicions.
Everything here was ordinary. Was he thinking all
sorts of nonsense because he had heard a conversation
not meant for him?</p>

<p>In the drawing-room he was amazed at the luxury
round him; the silk cushions and gorgeous embroideries
that were so strange in this corner of the Azores.</p>

<p>His companion made him sit down, and seated herself
on the floor. She looked up at him, her elbows on her
knees and her chin on her hands, and for the first time
he saw what a curious face she had.</p>

<p>There was something almost vacant in it, and yet it
was not a stupid face, only utterly indifferent. The eyes
that met his were startling in their strangeness, the irises
raying out a tawny golden-yellow, while the eyebrows
and lashes were like ink. The girl’s lips were a thrilling
crimson, and yet the mouth bore a look of suppression,
as if too early it had been acquainted with grief.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, with a sudden laugh that startled him,
“it is queer here. I am queer myself.”</p>

<p>Heriot smiled, though he was taken aback.</p>

<p>“You’re a child,” he said calmly; “you haven’t found
yourself yet.”</p>

<p>“Me? I never was a child,” she said, and her eyes
darkened as if some inward flame had been extinguished.
“No one who’s been Beryl Corselas all her life could ever
be a child.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean the convent, and Mother Felicitas,” she said
somberly, “and Andria and me. If Andria had not gone
away it might have been better.”</p>

<p>She looked straight at him, and something in his look
reminded her of Andria. His blue eyes had the same
look of self-reliance. His good looks did not strike her
at all; the golden-brown hair and mustache and the debonair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
face that had turned many a woman’s head
never touched Beryl Corselas one whit. He looked kind
and strong, and she liked him. That was all. Yet Andria
could have told her that in his day Heriot had been
the handsomest, most spoiled man in London.</p>

<p>“Do you mean Miss Holbeach,” he asked, with perceptible
hesitation and utter surprise, “was ever in a convent?”</p>

<p>Beryl nodded.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” she said. “It’s all very queer. If you
read it in a book you wouldn’t believe it. And that reminds
me,” she went on, laughing, “Andria was brought
here to teach me, and there isn’t a book in the house but
that funny, old one on the floor there. Mr. Egerton
couldn’t have really cared whether we did lessons or
not.”</p>

<p>“Begin at the beginning,” said Heriot, with the soft
voice women had found so sweet. “I can’t understand,
you know.”</p>

<p>But when she had reeled out the whole extraordinary
tale he leaned back and whistled softly.</p>

<p>Egerton, whoever he was, must know something of
Beryl Corselas’ history and want her out of the way. No
better place could have been found for a superfluous girl
to live than this unknown nook in the Azores. And no
other kind of woman than the late Mrs. Erle could have
been got to take pay for accompanying a kidnaped girl.
There was probably very little mystery in the affair to
her; she must know something from those far-away convent
days about the history of Beryl Corselas; which
might also explain why it had been convenient to get her
here, too, in addition to being a pliant tool in the hands
of a clever man. And that the girl had an affection for
her was another reason. Heriot knew the power of a
woman over a girl who idolizes her. That the whole
thing had been blind chance, he never thought for an
instant.</p>

<p>“Why do you think he brought you here?”—he kept
his interest out of his voice.</p>

<p>“I think,” she answered calmly, “to be eaten up. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
so does Andria. But Salome says he made her swear to
take care of us. And he did warn us himself, of course;
but I think that was for show, and so does Andria.”</p>

<p>“Eaten up!” Mr. Heriot gasped. He began to wonder
if the girl were queer in the head.</p>

<p>Beryl nodded.</p>

<p>“You don’t know. You don’t sleep in the house,” she
returned. “And, anyhow, it’s all right now, for they
know me.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The two old jaguars,” she said calmly, “and their
kittens. You saw their kittens this morning.”</p>

<p>“Know you! Jaguars!” This was worse and worse.
The girl was stark mad. If he had not seen her with the
cubs he would have thought it a lie from the word go.</p>

<p>“Yes, they do!” she asserted pettishly. “I sing—like
this—and they come. I can make them go away, too.
Even Andria is getting to know that I can.”</p>

<p>She sat upright and began the queer croon he had
heard once before, but this time he recognized it. It was
a snake-charmer’s song, wordless; a thing to make the
flesh crawl on the bones.</p>

<p>“Where did you learn it?” he asked, cutting her short.
He was not blood-brother to jaguars, and had no wish to
have them called in the open windows.</p>

<p>“I’ve always known it: I never learned it. I can do
anything with animals. Andria says mother must have
been a dompteuse—a lion-tamer, you know.”</p>

<p>“It does go from mother to daughter, they say,” he
returned rather faintly. He wondered if this Egerton
were, perhaps, her father, and then—but no man could
be so cold-bloodedly cruel as that! “There ought not to
be wild animals here,” he said out of his thoughts. “Are
these jaguars wild?”</p>

<p>Every vestige of animation left the girl’s face.</p>

<p>“No!” she breathed more than spoke. “And that’s the
only thing that frightens me. They’re trained; they have
a master, and they obey him. Do you remember I saw a
face that morning? Well,” as he nodded, “I think they
are his. I think he tries to set them on to kill us, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
I’ve managed them so far. If I could only get them to
like me best; they would obey me like dogs; but sometimes
I can’t get them to come to me at all. Andria is
afraid to let me play with them. One night I went out,
but she came after me and dragged me in. There was
nearly dreadful work that time; I could hardly keep them
off her—the cubs, I mean. If the old ones had been there
she would have been killed.”</p>

<p>“Then she does try to take care of you!” the words
escaped him, to his instant shame.</p>

<p>“Andria? She loves me! She came out to me when
they might have torn her up. But she isn’t afraid of that
thing that hunts with them. It climbs up the jalousies,
and hurries round the house all night, like a dried-up
monkey—only I know it’s a man!”</p>

<p>“Has she seen it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But I have, and I’m afraid of it. And
Andria gets wild if I talk of it. She says it’s all a
dream.”</p>

<p>“It’s a damned unpleasant one, then!” thought Heriot,
utterly at sea. If Egerton meant to do away with both
women, the lovely Andria was a fool to be here. If only
Beryl was to be got rid of, how was Mrs. Erle to save
herself? As he thought of her she came into the room.
She looked paler and more girlish than he had ever
dreamed she could look; her red-brown hair was coiled
simply round her head, and her plain, white gown was as
strange on her as the absence of her rings from her rose-white
hands.</p>

<p>“Oh!”—she stopped at the sight of him—“Mr. Heriot,
how did you—that is,” lamely, “I’m glad you are better!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you are, Mrs. Erle,” said Heriot’s blue
eyes. Somehow, the very sight of her had strengthened
the mistrust that was beginning to weaken.</p>

<p>“I managed to escape my stern jailer,” he said lightly.
“I suppose she thought my fever was catching, for she
locked me in.”</p>

<p>Andria turned scarlet. He saw quite well who had instructed
Salome. She sat down quite composedly, though
she did not look at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“Beryl, tell Salome we want tea, will you?” she said,
and, as the door closed on the girl, turned to Heriot. “It
was I who had you locked in,” she said hardly; “I was
afraid you might be tempted out and make your fever
worse.”</p>

<p>“You were very kind,” the irony in his voice barely
visible. “But I may as well tell you that Miss Corselas
has told me all about this queer business.”</p>

<p>“And you think I am paid by Mr. Egerton to get rid
of her?” she said, without a flicker of her eyes. “I don’t
think I am—yet! But I may be.”</p>

<p>“I won’t let you do it,” he answered calmly.</p>

<p>“Neither you nor any one else has a right to say that
to me,” she said, very low. “Because you know my past
is no reason I am all bad. And if I suspect Mr. Egerton
a hundred times over, I must remember that he warned
me to keep her out of danger. If he had meant her to
run into it he would have held his tongue.”</p>

<p>“He warned you, perhaps!” he was behaving like a cad,
and he knew it. But he could not believe in the late
Mrs. Erle.</p>

<p>“He knows nothing of me, and cares less.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take the girl away from here, if you
care for her?”</p>

<p>“How? You forget I don’t even know where we are.
Do you?”</p>

<p>Heriot winced.</p>

<p>“No,” he said unwillingly; “either Flores or Corvo, in
the Azores, but in an uninhabited part of either.”</p>

<p>“And I am to drag a delicate girl like that through
miles of scrub, with no money if I do get to a town? If
you think I knew what sort of place I was coming to you
are mistaken. He told me this was Bermuda.”</p>

<p>“Bermuda!”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“And I would think he meant us to live and die here
if he had not said he would come back and take me away
if I did not like it.”</p>

<p>“Did he say he would take the girl?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>“I—no!” she stammered. “I suppose he meant it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Yet you ask me to believe you know nothing of his
plans?” he asked politely. “Do you know, Mrs. Erle, I
have a great mind to help that poor child away myself?”</p>

<p>Quick as light she had risen and stood looking down
on him, her face as hard and brazen as that Andria Erle’s
whom he had despised, all its new-found purity gone.</p>

<p>“And do you think I would let you?” Her voice was
soft as usual, but for once it was not gentle. “Why
should I hand her over to any man, to suffer, perhaps, as
I’ve suffered? Believe me or not as you like, but I will
take care of her, against you and ten like you—against
Egerton himself, when he comes!”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t, if it came to main strength.”</p>

<p>“Could you?”—she pointed to his foot that was still
bandaged. He felt her contemptuous eyes on his body
that was thin and shaken with fever. “And have you
money that you could send her to England and take care
of her? Supposing she and you ever got out of the
scrub!</p>

<p>“This is my house to all purposes. If I told the black
women to put you out to-night they would do it. And I
suppose you know what would come to you then! You
can believe in me or not, as you like,” she said, with sudden
quietude, “but you cannot dictate terms to me, or
threaten me.”</p>

<p>For a long minute there was utter silence in the room.
Then Heriot, very white about the mouth, rose.</p>

<p>“I have to beg your pardon,” he said. “You are quite
right. I am in your debt.”</p>

<p>But as he turned to go back to his old quarters and
get away from this woman, she saw that she had only
made him distrust her more determinedly.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">TRUSTED TOO LATE.</p>


<p>To Heriot’s utter surprise, Salome at seven o’clock
brought him a message that the ladies were expecting
him at dinner. It occurred to him suddenly that second
thoughts had convinced the late Mrs. Erle that a man
who had been able to come to her secluded retreat would
be able to get away from it, and that the strange disappearance
of even an orphan girl might be a thing to
report to the police. To be the jailer of a kidnaped
damsel would not add glory to the record of any woman.</p>

<p>Before Beryl neither of the two betrayed their private
position. Andria was quiet, that was all. She let Heriot
talk to the girl as freely as he liked, and, in spite of his
prejudice, he saw that she never tried to stop any disclosures
of the terror that haunted them at night.</p>

<p>It was only when dinner was over that he saw her
expression change. A quick remembrance had come to
her. The servants had gone to bed; she dared not let
even her enemy, who might at any minute betray Beryl’s
faith in her, cross that courtyard in the dark.</p>

<p>Walls were no obstacles to the evening visitors at the
house; she had a quick, sickening vision of a snarling
pounce, a sound of worrying, and then a scream and a
crunching and tearing of flesh. And in the vision, too,
something that squatted on the wall and hounded on its
dreadful servants.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot,” she had risen abruptly from the comfortable
chair where her thoughts had been a torment
that even Heriot might have pitied, thoughts of old days
that had come back to her as if risen with this man from
the dead, “Mr. Heriot, it’s dark! Do you know you can’t
go back to your rooms?”</p>

<p>“I never meant to,” he answered quietly. “Did you
think that, after hearing all I have, I was going to leave
you two alone to face the night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>To his surprise, it was Beryl who bestowed a somber
glance on him; there was a queer relief on Andria’s face.</p>

<p>“You ought to have gone!” the girl cried. “You will
only be a trouble here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to be,” he laughed, in spite of himself. “I
can sleep quite well on this sofa.”</p>

<p>“If you sleep anywhere!”</p>

<p>“She’s right,” said Andria. “It will be worse if those
beasts smell you out. You should have gone.”</p>

<p>But, though she hated him for his unkindness, she was
glad of his company. Even an extra dog would have
been welcome in that house.</p>

<p>“Let us hope they won’t scent me.” He was only half
in earnest, thinking they exaggerated, as women do.</p>

<p>“I can manage them,” said Beryl softly. “They’re
tame, really,” and, without reason, Heriot’s heart thrilled
with pride at the fearless, almost careless, voice.</p>

<p>It was torture to Andria to sit in the room with the
man who knew her history and despised her for it. It
brought back those London nights with the supper-room
windows open on a moonlit garden, when Andria Erle, in
satin and diamonds, had fleeted time carelessly, reckless
of what men thought of her. She cared now. She would
have given all her beauty to have seen respect in Heriot’s
eyes, casual acquaintance though he was. And the very
way he turned his sentences brought back Raimond, haggard,
brown-eyed, gentlemanly, with that way he had of
smiling.</p>

<p>In spite of herself her heart cried out for the man who
had been her all. To shake off her thoughts she rose as
soon as she dared, and carried Beryl off to bed.</p>

<p>Heriot, left alone, remembered something.</p>

<p>Salome, at a word from Andria, had produced cigars.
He rummaged about and found them on a side table.
They were Egerton’s, but Heriot was in no mood to be
particular. He had had nothing to smoke in the three
weeks he had been in this queer place.</p>

<p>He lit a perfecto and leaned back in sweet content as
the blue smoke curled upward. For a little while he forgot
everything but the joy of his smoke, and then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
close heat of the room annoyed him. He limped over to
a window and unbarred it, but hardly a breath came in.
Without a thought of the tales of jaguars or their
strange master, Heriot opened the veranda jalousies and
sniffed the air of the gorgeous night.</p>

<p>A honey-colored moon swam in the sky, even the colors
of the flowers in the garden were visible, and the scent of
oleander-blossoms rose like incense in his nostrils. With
a sigh of content, he turned back into the room and
picked up the only book it contained. The yellow pages
opened of their own accord at a worn passage, and as he
read it he wondered.</p>

<p>“As sure as the turquoise attracts love and the amethyst
repels it, so does the beryl bring bad dreams.”</p>

<p>He turned to the title-page.</p>

<p>“Jewels—Their Verye Majicke Vertue,” he saw in
thick, old lettering, and went back to the passage he was
reading.</p>

<p>“This is a queer Beryl; I wonder if she will bring bad
dreams,” he thought sleepily, as his cigar burned out.
Too lazy to move, he dozed in his chair, while the lamps
burned low and flickered in the rising breeze.</p>

<p>A pleasant sound, hurrying, pattering, like heavy rain
on a roof, soothed him dreamily.</p>

<p>His head rested more heavily on the silk cushions of
his deep chair; he still saw the dimly lighted room, but
mistily, as in a dream.</p>

<p>His eyelids fell at last, his long lashes rested on his
brown cheek.</p>

<p>The hurrying patter outside ceased.</p>

<p>If any one looked with wild incredulity through the
open jalousy Heriot did not see them; if softly and
soundlessly something slipped in and crept behind his
chair he did not hear, or know what curved, crooked
fingers itched to clutch at his throat, and yet were kept
from it by a cunning mind.</p>

<p>The man was asleep; would stay asleep till—something
woke him.</p>

<p>A minute later Heriot opened his eyes, and leaped to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
his feet as one who shakes off a dream at a half-heard
sound.</p>

<p>Had he seen, for one second, a face, jeering and malicious,
glance back at him from the door into the passage?
And did he see that door closing softly now?
And did he hear quite close, and coming nearer, quick,
yelping whines, as of beasts hunting?</p>

<p>Heriot rushed to the open jalousy, tore it to him and
barred it; shut and locked the window into the room.
And not an instant too soon, for something soft, yet tremendously
heavy, had hurled itself against his jalousy;
but the good wood held.</p>

<p>“The jaguars! It was true, then,” he thought almost
unconsciously, for there was no time for thinking when
something worse than a jaguar was on its way to those
two defenseless women up-stairs. Regardless of his lameness,
he raced up-stairs.</p>

<p>There were lights everywhere, and perfect silence
everywhere, too. Had he dreamed that evil, fleering face—that
misshapen body, with its crooked claws of hands?</p>

<p>A scream, so wild and dreadful in that lonely house
that it turned his blood to fire, answered him. Yet the
thrilling note of it was rage—not fear!</p>

<p>“All right!” he shouted; “I’m coming!” and ran in the
direction of the sound.</p>

<p>Andria Erle, white as ashes, her teeth showing as her
lips curled back from them, was half-facing him, as she
threw Beryl back through a half-open door. As Heriot
ran to her she banged it to, and shut it on the girl; and
then he saw what sickened him. There were hands like
claws clasped round Mrs. Erle’s bare throat, and a monster
that bit buried in the nape of her lovely neck.</p>

<p>“Bolt the door, Beryl—quick!” her voice came choked.
“Never mind—me!”</p>

<p>Heriot’s arms shot over her shoulder as she spoke.
But he missed the ghastly thing that clung around her.
He jumped to drag it off her, but it eluded him; with the
noiseless spring of a cat it had dropped to the ground and
vanished somewhere in the winding passage.</p>

<p>Andria panted desperately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“Beryl is all right,” she said. “He can’t get at her.
Beryl, can you let us in?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Oh, Andria!” in anguish, “no! The bolt’s
stuck.”</p>

<p>“Don’t move it, then.” Andria was trembling from
head to foot. “Lock your window. Is Salome there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, missus! Wait, we’ll get you in.”</p>

<p>“No!” with authority. “I’m all right; Mr. Heriot’s
here. Don’t open that door, Salome, till I tell you to.
Promise!”</p>

<p>“I can’t open it,” said the black woman with despair.
“Oh, Miss Holbeach! Run somewhere—quick! He’s
in; he’ll let dem in!”</p>

<p>Andria clutched Heriot’s arm.</p>

<p>“She’s right!” she cried. “Come! See my room. I
left a light there, and now it’s dark!”</p>

<p>“I’ll break the crazy brute’s neck!” said Heriot furiously.
“Let go my arm, please!” To his anger, she was
strong as he.</p>

<p>“Not without a revolver,” she said imperiously. “Have
you no sense? You can’t do anything but get killed—and
then I’m gone, too. Come!”</p>

<p>Even in his rage Heriot saw she was right. He was in
no trim to fight a madman, with no weapon but his hands.</p>

<p>In utter silence he ran with her up the lighted stairs
and into the first room they came to. There was a lamp
burning, for it was Egerton’s sitting-room, and by his
orders never dark, even in his absence. But as they entered
it they heard pattering footsteps on their trail.</p>

<p>“Stop!” Andria caught Heriot as he would have shut
the door. “We daren’t. He might get in at Beryl.”</p>

<p>She seized a hard-stuffed bolster from a corner, and,
before he could stop her, had sent it twice through the
window, with a crash and fall of splintered glass. There
was a veranda outside, but no jalousies; nothing to keep
an evil thing imprisoned. With an irresistible force she
dragged Heriot behind a table, whose cloth reached the
ground, and made him crouch there beside her. His arm
felt like iron under her fingers. He was waiting for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
fight, and saw nothing in her breaking the window but an
attempt to fly that way, quickly abandoned as useless.</p>

<p>The hurrying, relentless steps came in, stopped. Then,
with a snarling cry of wordless rage, their strange enemy
saw the open window. Like a flash, he bounded to it,
through it; and Heriot, quicker than he had ever moved
in his life, leaped after him. Andria pointed to a heavy
chest of drawers.</p>

<p>“That!” she cried. “Keep him out!” and, somehow,
the two moved the heavy thing across the window. From
outside, without a purchase, it would have taken a Sandow
to move it; but the two, with one consent, moved
quickly from the room. Heriot shut and locked the heavy
door behind them, rejoicing in the iron clamps on the
solid wood, but marveling no longer.</p>

<p>“How did he get in?” cried Andria; she leaned against
the wall, pale and trembling.</p>

<p>“Come back to Beryl. It’s all right now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” but he did not move. “Turn round,” he said
authoritatively; “let me see your neck! Do you know
that brute bit you?”</p>

<p>His whole manner utterly changed, and he laid a hand
on her shoulder, where her white dressing-gown was torn
to ribbons. He felt a shudder run through her.</p>

<p>“I didn’t—feel it!” she said jerkily. “I was so frightened
for Beryl.”</p>

<p>Heriot’s face was dark with shame.</p>

<p>“My God!” he muttered as he saw the deep marks of
teeth in the nape of her neck. “I ought to be kicked.
Mrs. Erle, I have to beg your pardon a thousand times.
I’ve behaved like a beastly cad. I—do you know, it’s all
my fault?”</p>

<p>“Is it deep? Will it be poisoned?” She took no heed
of his words, and he saw that at last there was terror in
her face.</p>

<p>“No!” he lied bravely, sickening at the jagged marks,
where the blood oozed. “Come here! Where can I get
some water?” but as he spoke his quick eye caught a can
standing at the head of the stairs, ready to fill the morning
baths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“Kneel down, and don’t be frightened, please,” he said
gently. “If there is any poison I’ll get it out.”</p>

<p>Half-mad with disgust, she did not realize what he
meant to do till she felt his lips on her neck. He was
sucking the poison from the wound!</p>

<p>At first she nearly flung him from her, and then she
buried her face in her hands. There was no one else.
Beryl she could not let do it, and Salome was black.
But Andria was whiter than marble and cold from head
to foot. When the sickening business was done, as she
rose from her knees she staggered.</p>

<p>“I ought to thank you,” but she did not look at him.
“You——”</p>

<p>“I’m not fit to black your shoes,” he cut her short, with
a queer sound in his voice. “For God’s sake, Mrs. Erle,
forgive me if you can. I thought you were on Egerton’s
side, and in his pay to get rid of the girl. And I’ve just
seen you ready to chuck your life away for her.”</p>

<p>“I’m not what you think me. I never was.” She put
her hand to her throat and cried out at the pain of the
bruised flesh she touched.</p>

<p>“I think you are a good woman,” said Heriot, “and the
bravest on God’s earth. I can’t forgive myself. Do you
know, it was I let that brute in?”</p>

<p>From very weakness the tears came in her eyes as he
told her how; yet spoke up bravely.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I’m not frightened of the bite if you
trust me now. You’ve seen—you must believe me!”</p>

<p>Heriot looked at her, pale and wild in her torn dressing-gown,
her beautiful face ghastly. This was the
woman he had dared to judge; and she had dared to risk
her life for the very girl he had thought she meant to betray.
And it was he who had really caused that wound
that bled still. He could have gone on his knees in his
shame and humiliation.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said quietly, “get the others to let you in,
and go to bed.”</p>

<p>“I can’t sleep;” she shook like a leaf, but she followed
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>Salome got the door open in what seemed an endless
time, as Andria stood outside with chattering teeth.</p>

<p>“Miss Holbeach!” the woman cried wildly, “it’s daylight!
An’ I heard de engines in de bay. De ship’s got
back!” she ran past Andria to the top of the house.</p>

<p>The world lay quiet in the hour of daybreak, and Egerton’s
yacht lay at anchor in the gray wanness of the calm
water.</p>

<p>“You’re sure, Salome?” Andria cried. Too stiff and
weary to move, only her eyes looked alive in her pale
face.</p>

<p>“It’s de boat, it mayn’t be him. Oh, my land, Miss
Holbeach, dey’s blood on you dress! He’ll kill me.
Honey, let ole Salome see! Whata done got yer?”</p>

<p>But Heriot saw she knew.</p>

<p>“If it is Egerton,” he observed grimly, “he won’t have
everything his own way. He’ll be amenable enough
when he finds he hasn’t only women to bully.”</p>

<p>Andria started.</p>

<p>“He mustn’t find you here!” she cried. “Perhaps he
has come to take us away. You must go back to the
quarters till I find out what he means to do.”</p>

<p>“We can’t go away and leave him here!” said Beryl
sharply, pointing to Heriot.</p>

<p>“We won’t. If Egerton means to take us back to
England we’ll make him take Mr. Heriot, too. He
mayn’t know how dreadful things are here—he may be
better than we think.”</p>

<p>“He knows, honey,” said Salome pitifully. “Don’t you
put no trust in dat.”</p>

<p>“You must hide, don’t you see it?” Andria repeated.
“This is Egerton’s house. If he finds you here he can
turn you out. And then what help could you be to us?”</p>

<p>“He’d have his work cut out,” Heriot returned, almost
smiling, standing straight and tall among the three
women.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t cut out no more’n he could do,” observed
Salome dryly. “Dat crew on board dat yacht is all cutthroat
dagos, dey’d do whatever he tell ’em, knife you
or drown you. I been six years in dis house, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
mind me—dey ain’t no chance here in a fight for any one
but Mr. Egerton heself!”</p>

<p>“If you want to help us,” begged Andria, “go into the
quarters and wait. Chloe and Amelia Jane won’t tell,
they’re too frightened of him to speak to him if they can
help it.” It was the best way. To see a strange man
here might turn Egerton’s good intentions into bad ones.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t!” said Heriot, with an angry laugh. “I’d
rather have things out with the man.”</p>

<p>A slim, cool hand was on his wrist as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Wait and see,” said Beryl. “Please, Mr. Heriot. Then
if he means badly to us you’ll be here to help us.”</p>

<p>Voice and touch were exactly like a child’s. Heriot
flushed as he met the tawny eyes that were so innocent.</p>

<p>“All right,” he returned reluctantly. “But if there’s
going to be any delay about taking you away from this
you’ll let me know, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Andria nodded. This girl, fresh from the convent,
had bent the man’s will as all her own worldly wisdom
could not do. She glanced from one to the other with a
pang at her heart. Love was a bitter thing. If it grew
up between them how would it end? She bit her lip, remembering
her own love’s beginning.</p>

<p>Salome had run out into the veranda. She came back
now frowning with excitement.</p>

<p>“It’s him, he’s back! Coming up de path wid two
sailors,” she cried. “Whatever’ll we do if he sees Mr.
Heriot?”</p>

<p>“He won’t!” said Beryl promptly. “Mr. Heriot’s
going into the quarters to wait and see what happens.
Chloe and Amelia won’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t no sense in trusting dem niggers. You stay
here, and I’ll tell ’em you’re gone—went last night. Dey
won’t tell you’s been here when dey might tell you is
here,” she said shrewdly, and she was off and back before
it seemed possible.</p>

<p>“Come, down de side stairs,” she whispered. “Chloe
and ’Melia’s comin’ up de front ones now to get ready
master’s room. Hurry!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>She dragged him off as she spoke, and Beryl turned to
Andria.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Look!” said Andria, and bent down.</p>

<p>The girl drew back with a cry.</p>

<p>“You got that, to save me!”</p>

<p>“I got it, anyhow,” grimly. “I’ll show him that and
the broken window in his room where the man went out.
I dare him to leave us here after that. I wonder what
brought him back so soon?”</p>

<p>“He could have been here before. It’s only six days
to England. Andria, do you think he’s come to take us
away?”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Beryl, very low. “But I think he
hates me worse than Mother Felicitas did. Listen; don’t
tell him those jaguars are tame—don’t tell him I play
with the kittens. Let him think we’re afraid.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid. There’s no thinking about it.”</p>

<p>“Tell him about the crazy man, make more of that, for
that’s really the root of all,” Beryl persisted, with more
truth than she knew.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you want him to know the beasts aren’t
really dangerous?”</p>

<p>“They are,” coolly, “as far as he is concerned. Andria,
are you going to meet him like that, all torn and
bloody?” looking at the other woman’s flimsy muslin
gown, whose real lace was in shreds.</p>

<p>“It won’t hurt him to see it, I had to feel it,” Andria
answered dully. “Beryl, did you notice something last
night? When that dreadful, wizened creature came jabbering
into our room last night, it wasn’t you he sprang
at, it was I! If he had made for you I couldn’t have
done anything.”</p>

<p>“I saw,” but to Andria’s surprise she broke into a passion
of tears. “Oh, Andria,” she sobbed, “what’s wrong
with me that all strange things fear me? Am I half a
beast, or crazy, like that dumb, jabbering man?”</p>

<p>But Andria never answered. For once she let the girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
she loved cry to her in vain. She was on her feet,
breathless, listening with every nerve.</p>

<p>Did every one who came to this dreadful house lose
their senses? or did she in very truth hear a voice she
had never thought to hear this side of the grave?</p>

<p>Frantic, she hushed the girl who sobbed beside her.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, listen!” her hand like a vise on Beryl’s
shoulder. “There’s some one else there with Mr. Egerton.”</p>

<p>A man’s voice, sweet and drawling, came up the stairs
from the entrance-hall.</p>

<p>“By George! You do yourself well in your country
retreat. The man must have been crazy to sell it to you
for such a song!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he was,” the answer was dry and significant.
“My dear boy,” Egerton said in his ordinary tone, “did
you expect me to keep my ward in a tent?”</p>

<p>Andria staggered back against Beryl, whose tears had
dried on her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I’m faint,” she muttered, “ill. Tell them they can’t
see me. I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p>The strength gone from her muscles, her feet barely
carrying her, she wrenched herself from Beryl’s hold and
crept, more than walked, to her room. That was Egerton
down-stairs, and with him was—Raimond Erle!</p>

<p>Why was he here? What had brought him?</p>

<p>She flung herself down on her bed, laughing and crying
with incredulous joy. There could be but one reason,
he must have found out from Egerton that she was here;
must have wearied for her as she had for him, and come
himself to tell her that that letter was all a lie; that she
was still his wife, always had been and always would be,
world without end.</p>

<p>“Thank God! Oh, thank God!” gasped Andria Erle,
face down on her bed. She knew now that she could
never forget the man who had been all hers, never look
on any other but with indifferent eyes. She could forgive
Egerton for all the mystery that was round her,
could thank him even with that smarting wound at the
back of her neck that had brought her here. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
been but half-alive all these weeks, a ghost of herself.
Now she could rise again as from her grave, and dress
herself to go down fresh and fair when Raimond sent for
her. For the first time she was glad the French maid
had disobeyed her and packed the gowns she had never
meant to wear again.</p>

<p>Not even a thought of all she had to forgive crossed
her mind. He was here, he had come for her; that was
all.</p>

<p>She rose with feverish haste. There was a pale lilac
gown he had liked—“he said I looked like spring in it,”
she thought, hunting in her boxes till she found it.</p>

<p>She looked like spring indeed when she had it on and
remembered the day he had bought it for her. It deepened
her blue-gray eyes into violet, set off her cream-white
skin and ruddy hair. Heriot, the past night, forgotten
as if they had never been, she stared at herself.</p>

<p>“I’m handsomer than I was,” she thought, with a leaping
heart, “fairer, softer! He will be glad, glad when he
sees me. But I won’t go down till he sends.”</p>

<p>The soft lilac stuff fell in lovely folds round her as she
turned at a knock at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” she cried; she could not make her voice
quiet. “Come in.”</p>

<p>It was Amelia Jane, carrying her breakfast.</p>

<p>“I thought you was sick!” she cried. “My soul, I
dunno when I see you look so well.”</p>

<p>“I’m better—well! Tell me”—the question came beyond
her will—“did—did Mr. Egerton send me any message?
Is Miss Beryl at breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m. She an’ Mr. Egerton an’ another gentleman.
No, he didn’t send no message.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said, her voice oddly flat and unmusical.</p>

<p>“Put the breakfast down, please, Amelia.”</p>

<p>But when the woman was gone she made no attempt to
eat; only sank into a chair as if her new-found strength
had somehow failed her. If she had been in Raimond
Erle’s place, could she have waited all this time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Not one minute of it,” said her starving heart. “Not
one minute!”</p>

<p>The color faded from her face as she sat and watched
the clock. Ten minutes, twenty, three-quarters of an
hour—and he had not come, though breakfast must long
have been over. She could not sit still and wait like this,
dared not go down and meet him before the others.</p>

<p>“I’ll get up and walk up and down. Perhaps by the
time I count a thousand steps he’ll be here! Only a
thousand little steps, dear saints, and I’ll see him, kiss
him, be in his arms.”</p>

<p>She had barely counted a hundred in her wild walk
when a man’s step sounded in the hall, a man’s knock on
her door.</p>

<p>Radiant, triumphant, incredulous of her own joy, she
sprang to the door and flung it wide.</p>

<p>Every drop of blood in her body seemed to surge back
to her heart. Egerton, tall, suave, middle-aged, stood on
her threshold.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Holbeach,” he said, “good morning. I
am sorry to find you not well. I hope my unexpected
arrival did not startle you.”</p>

<p>And indeed she looked ill enough, and startled enough
for anything, as she leaned hard on the door-handle that
she might not fall. Every vestige of color had gone from
her face, even her lips were ashy.</p>

<p>“I’m only faint—I had a fright,” she could only mutter
incoherently, as she tried for the breath that came so
hardly, “a fright—last night.”</p>

<p>“My poor lady,” he said quite kindly. “I see you are
altogether unstrung. I came to ask you to come to my
room. I wish to tell you——”</p>

<p>“Oh! not there,” she cried, with an uncontrollable
shudder. “Not there!”</p>

<p>“May I come in here, then?” he asked courteously.
“This is your sitting-room, I imagine.”</p>

<p>Andria glanced backward at the door she had so carefully
closed that Raimond Erle might not see her disordered
bedroom, where she had thrown down gown
after gown in the search for this one that should please
him.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said, with white lips, anxious only to
get the door into the passage shut lest Raimond might
pass by, and Egerton looked at her covertly as she sank
into a chair, too nerveless to stand. There must have
been wild work here to make this woman look as she did.
He had heard nothing from either Beryl or Salome, who
had both been silent and sullen; but he knew from Andria’s
face that she had seen what perhaps he had meant
her to see when he brought her here, but what now—since
his purpose had changed—he had nearly burst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
boilers of his yacht in trying to get here in time to prevent.</p>

<p>For Andria was right, he had never meant to return,
his warnings to her and Salome had all been a blind;
Beryl Corselas, when first he found her, had been a burden
to get rid of, he had not dared to let her stay in England
or let his name be heard in connection with her.
Here in this island he had meant her to disappear for
good and all—but, of course, to his deep sorrow and surprise!
He was so careful a scoundrel that he had acted
a part even before the servant who was his miserable
slave and the woman he had engaged because of her
probable unscrupulousness. That he had warned them
had been all that kept Egerton from cursing himself for
a fool all the way from England. One paragraph in a
paper had made those sham warnings real. Lord Erceldonne
had sent for his son, and two days after set out in
hot haste for his secret retreat, terrified that his plans
might have flourished so well as to ruin him.</p>

<p>In the long pause Andria’s slow pulses were loud in
her ears; but she had pulled herself together. After all,
it was natural that Egerton should come first, natural
that he should be puzzled how to open a difficult subject;
and of course he must be in Raimond’s confidence.
But when he did speak it was not about the man he had
brought with him.</p>

<p>“Miss Holbeach,” he said slowly, “you said you had
been frightened. Do you mean in this house? Or out of
doors? I warned you, you remember!”</p>

<p>“You warned me, and yet you left me here with a defenseless
girl,” she said almost inaudibly. She cared
little now for the horrors she had suffered; he had come
to take them away. Raimond was here; it was all past
and gone.</p>

<p>“There was no reason not to leave you here,” he lied
calmly. “I will be quite frank with you, there had been a
reason; but I learned from Salome that it had quite disappeared.”</p>

<p>There was a sort of lethargy in Andria’s soul; nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
mattered now but Raimond. Yet at the plausible untruth
she shook it off.</p>

<p>“It appeared again the very night you left here!” she
cried. “A man came, a little, wizened man, like an ape,
that hurried around the house and climbed up the jalousies
like a monkey. And the next day I saw his face
over my shoulder in the pond, a leering thing that
mouthed at me——”</p>

<p>“The pond! I told you to keep away from that path,”
the anger that was sincere at last steadied her nerves.</p>

<p>“I went to get Beryl. She had strayed there.” The
governess looked him in the face with eyes that were
magnificent. “I took care that she never went again.
But that’s not all. There are beasts here, dreadful
jaguars. All night long they hunt and sniff about the
house, they climb the jalousies and—I’ve seen their
eyes!” with a shudder. “Oh, Mr. Egerton, take us
away!”</p>

<p>The man had started to his feet.</p>

<p>“It is what I came to do,” he answered hurriedly.
“Believe me, I had no idea of this. I thought the place
was safe—Salome said so.”</p>

<p>“Safe for white women!” She rose, too, as the scornful
cry broke from her. “I will show you how safe it is.
Look here!” She pulled down the lace and ribbon at the
back of her collar. “Look at that. Do you know there
was nearly murder done here last night. I don’t know
why there wasn’t.”</p>

<p>She bent her head, and at sight of the double rows of
deep-crimson punctures where the piece had been all but
bitten out, the man who had brought her to this evil
place was dumb, though a month ago it might have
suited him well enough. She straightened her collar
again with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>“What did that?” Egerton moistened his lips. “Not a
beast? You—you never could have got away!”</p>

<p>“A man,” she said quietly, “a man, dumb, and crazy,
and strong, so strong that only God saved me from him.
We were standing in Beryl’s room when he came in on
us, running, stooping so low that he seemed to be on all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
fours. I ran between him and Beryl and he jumped on
my back. I felt his teeth through my flesh. I ran out
into the hall with his fingers round my throat and shut
the door on the girl. Then”—her hesitation was so momentary
that he did not see it—“something frightened
the thing. It let me go and I ran. Did you see there was
a chest of drawers against your sitting-room window?
It was I put it there. I broke the window when I
ran in there, and the man thought I had gone out
through the broken pane and followed me. I moved
the chest—locked the door”—her chest heaved at the
memory; tears born of that suspense that was eating at
her heart blinded her. “Oh, surely you didn’t know what
you were leaving us to!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Where was Salome?” He was not given to swearing,
but he barely kept in a furious oath.</p>

<p>“In Beryl’s bedroom. She saw nothing, knew nothing
till I and—that thing—were out in the hall. She has
done everything to keep us safe.”</p>

<p>“Whereas you evidently think I brought you here to be
murdered!” he returned, a queer look in his black eyes
that seemed blacker than ever. “Well, I can’t wonder if
you do! Sit down, please, and rest. I owe you a very
deep gratitude.”</p>

<p>He bent his head to hide his face, which was not grateful.
In his inmost soul he would have been glad if this
foolhardy woman had behaved like a good, sensible coward.
It would have cut the knot that galled him night
and day, though it would have cost him a fortune. Perhaps
not that, he would have been in a position to seek
other girls with money.</p>

<p>“It’s a long story,” he cut off his thoughts hastily,
since what was done was done, “but I must tell it to you
to explain. Might I smoke? You don’t mind? Perhaps
you will have a cigarette yourself?”</p>

<p>“I? No, I never smoke,” she said, with annoyed surprise.</p>

<p>Mr. Egerton broke out into that hoarse cackle of a
laugh that always jarred on Andria’s nerves. He had
noticed cigar smoke heavy in the shut-up drawing-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the very instant he had entered the house at dawn; had
seen the butt of one of his own cigars reposing in a
flower-pot. And now the governess’ hasty lie amused
him even in his annoyance. A cigar, too, of all things!</p>

<p>“Many women do smoke, even cigars,” he said urbanely.
“I beg your pardon if I thought you had the
habit. It seemed quite possible.”</p>

<p>Then he did know about her past when the few
women she had known smoked like chimneys! She never
remembered having told Salome that Heriot must have
cigars; she only wished Egerton would go on. Would
he never get to Raimond Erle? She looked at his face
and imagined it pleased him to tantalize her.</p>

<p>“What does it all mean?” she asked. “Though I suppose
it doesn’t matter if we are going away.”</p>

<p>“It does matter. I don’t want you to think me a murderer,”
he said, so gently that it brought back to her another
voice which each minute seemed an hour till she
heard. “But I must go back a long way to make you
understand. Twenty years ago I saw this place first. I
was yachting and found it by chance. The house stood
exactly as it does now, but it was surrounded by magnificent
gardens, was full of servants and luxury. There
were only two people in it, a retired planter of forty, and
his daughter. She was the most beautiful person I have
ever seen, but that,” hastily, “was not my affair, nor, if
her father could help it, any one else’s. I saw then the
man was mad. He told me he would shoot the first man
who wished to marry his daughter, had brought her
here out of the world that she might live and die unmarried;
a girl who was more beautiful than any woman
alive!</p>

<p>“‘He would not have her suffer as women suffered,’
he said. ‘All men were cruel, she should not be at the
mercy of any.’ She was his idol. His only other interest
was wild animals. He had a regular menagerie—lions, a
tiger, jaguars—and he and that girl would play with
them as if they were lambs. It used to make my blood
run cold to see them. She would sit among the jaguars
crooning a queer song”—Andria’s hands that lay on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
knees clenched with the effort not to cry out; did he
know how dreadful a thing he was telling her? did he
mean the madman’s daughter was Beryl’s mother?—“till
the beasts came fawning round her like a kitten. Oh, I
know it sounds like a fairy-tale! But I saw it.”</p>

<p>Only her innate caution, her habit of distrust, kept her
from a quick disclosure. Long afterward she knew she
had saved her life by holding her peace.</p>

<p>“Well, I went away! The girl was nothing to me,” he
continued, looking not at Andria, but his half-smoked
cigarette, so that, being a woman, she knew the girl had
been everything to him and he nothing at all to her. “I
came back again two years afterward—and I would not
have known the place. The beautiful gardens were a
tangle of creepers and weeds, the servants were all gone;
the animals dead from starvation in their enclosures, all
but the jaguars, that had broken loose and foraged for
themselves. The man I found at last, ragged, thin, half-naked,
and at first he would not speak to me; would only
jabber at me without words.”</p>

<p>“Then it was he!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he nodded. “He was dumb, mad, but by and
by his madness cleared a little and he told me what had
happened. A stranger had come to the island; it was the
old story that I need not dwell on”—reflecting hastily
that it was one this woman probably knew from cover to
cover. “She defied her father and ran away with him in
a native boat. The man dismissed his servants and sat
alone in his misery, and then heard that all his money,
which had been in Brazilian bonds, was lost. He had not
a penny to go and seek her through the world. He forgot,
as I said, even his animals; almost forgot the use of
his tongue, for only at intervals could I make him talk.
Well, I was sorry for him!” What vindictive light lit
his eyes to her sharp vision! “I liked the place and
bought it for a toy, merely that the old man,” he continued
slowly, “might be free to go and find his daughter
who had deserted him.”</p>

<p>The words were so gently spoken that it took all her
cleverness to grasp their meaning. He had tried to set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
a madman on the track of the woman who had refused
him and the man she had loved. Her eyes dilated with
abhorrence, and yet his next words came so smoothly that
she did not know what to think, and there was no one
to tell her how cunningly he was mingling the truth with
lies.</p>

<p>“You would have pitied him, too; he had aged twenty
years in the two that had passed. All he wanted was to
find his daughter, yet when I gave him money he was too
crazy to go. He threw it before my eyes into that pond
you spoke of and went off to some lair in the woods with
his jaguars.” He did not say how pitifully inadequate
had been the purchase-money, nor that the lawful owner
had been hunted away by men with guns. “In all the
years I have been coming here I have only once had any
evidence that he was alive”—that once would have made
any other man long for the grave that he might hide his
shame there!—“and Salome, who has been in charge here
for six years, swore to me when I brought you that the
place was safe. I am more shocked and horrified than I
can say that you should have been in such danger from
that lunatic and his animals. To-morrow, if you like, I
will have my yacht’s crew scour the country till we find
him.”</p>

<p>“Let him be,” said Andria pitifully. “Besides, if we
are going away! And we shall be quite safe with you in
the house”—“and Raimond!” she added in her mind, the
thought of him bringing light to her eyes, color to her
lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly,” he agreed quickly, though he had no
idea of sleeping in the house or letting the man he had
brought with him sleep there either. That madman
would tear him limb from limb if he could; Mr. Egerton
knew only too well that the very sight of him would
rouse boundless fury in the dumb thing that ran up and
down the deserted gardens whence his delight had fled.
He would never dare to stay in the house knowing that
his crazy enemy had ever been able to enter it.</p>

<p>“How did he get in?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t quite know,” she stammered. “I was up-stairs.”</p>

<p>She had forgotten all about Heriot stuffed away in the
servants’ quarters till now. She had it on the tip of her
tongue to avow everything, but something furtive, dishonest,
in Egerton’s face stopped her.</p>

<p>“Better wait,” she thought. “I can tell Raimond first.
He will know what to do.”</p>

<p>And though Egerton had explained far more than he
had imagined to her all was not clear yet. As he rose to
go she rose, too, and looked at him.</p>

<p>“Why did you tell me this was Bermuda?” she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>“From inadvertency, at first—the house is called Bermuda.
Then because I feared you would rebel against
being banished to an uninhabited part of the Azores. I
fancied you had not been accustomed to—dulness!” and
at the covert meaning of the words and the lie that began
them, she caught her breath. There had been no inadvertence
in his mention of Bermuda, first or last.</p>

<p>“I wanted Beryl out of England, you’re right!” he
added, as if he knew what was in her mind. “I pitied
her. I had no wish to see a long arm stretched out from
the convent to claim her, for of course she has told you
her story. I hope to see her happily married, not dragging
out existence in prison, all but the name. And I
knew no other place to put her. But that,” with his queer
laugh, “will be remedied now.”</p>

<p>Something in the assured expectancy of his voice woke
a dreadful thought in Andria Erle. Like a flash the
glamour fell from her eyes, she put two and two together.
He meant to see Beryl safely married; he had
brought Raimond Erle to this place; the things dovetailed
with horrible accuracy, though she could not see
what Raimond had to do with Egerton.</p>

<p>“You mean——” she said; she could hardly speak.</p>

<p>“I mean one never knows what the day may bring
forth,” he answered lightly. “If you look from your
window you may understand.”</p>

<p>She had no need to. Their voices, Beryl’s and Raimond’s,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
came up to her gaily where she stood. Had she
been deaf not to have heard them before?</p>

<p>It was as if a gulf of darkness had opened under her
feet, yet she would not flinch if pride could keep her
steady. Raimond—did Egerton mean it was for her sake
he had come?</p>

<p>Egerton, watching the hot color come and go in the
governess’ face, wondered he had never seen how beautiful
she was. She would be a dangerous rival for that
half-fledged girl down-stairs. He hoped there were not
going to be any troublesome complications.</p>

<p>“You are not coming down to-day, you said!” he suggested.
“Perhaps you are right, and it would be well to
rest.”</p>

<p>She was ready to say she would go down now, this
instant, when she remembered he was her master; that
governesses did not always come to the table with guests.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would,” she answered, and the coldness of
her voice pleased him.</p>

<p>“I have not mentioned you, at least your name,” he
had the grace not to look at her, even though he had no
idea she and Erle had ever met; “I thought, perhaps, you
would prefer not to meet strangers.”</p>

<p>“No,” and by good luck he did not see her face, “not
strangers, though there is no earthly reason you should
not mention my name,” for Holbeach would mean nothing
to Raimond. “I will go down when you send for
me.”</p>

<p>As the door closed behind him she caught at the table
to hold herself up. Her eyes were narrowed to slits, and
her nostrils pinched as she breathed. From the scented
shade of the oleanders below her there floated up a man’s
laugh, low and sweet. Agony racked her as even she had
not known it could without killing her.</p>

<p>“Strangers,” she said in a dreadful whisper, “he
and I!”</p>

<p>Her face convulsed out of all beauty, she ran to the
window and looked out behind the jalousy. In the garden,
tall, handsome in a haggard, hard-bitten way—and
oh, God, beloved!—lounged the man who had been her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
husband for five years. It took all her will to crush back
the cry on her lips. She knew from his face it was not
for her he had come back. He had forgotten.</p>

<p>“Then why is he here?” she asked herself. But she
dared not answer her own soul.</p>

<p class="center">BEHIND THE CYPRESS BOUGHS.</p>


<p>“Andria!” a soft tap came at her locked door. “Let
me in. Why haven’t you been down all day?”</p>

<p>“I was busy,” Andria answered, shutting the door behind
Beryl. She had been busy, indeed, and if Egerton
had seen her now he would have had no fears that her
beauty might be a snare to any man’s feet. The pale
mauve gown had vanished with all the others that littered
her bedroom; in the plainest black gown she owned,
Andria stood, tall and pale, her eyes sunken, her mouth
drawn; it was as if she had aged ten years.</p>

<p>Beryl sat down on the table, a bright rose spot burning
in each cheek.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d come down. I don’t like it without
you,” she said restlessly. “Isn’t your throat well
enough?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’d forgotten it. Why do you want
me? Don’t you like—him?” for her life she could not
say the name.</p>

<p>“Who? Mr. Egerton. I’ve always loathed him,”
Beryl said angrily, “and I always shall. If it were not
for being with you, I’d rather he’d left me in the workhouse!”</p>

<p>“No”—hesitating—“the other?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. No, I don’t think I do! I liked him
when I was with him, but I hate him when I remember
his eyes. He looked at me as if I were something to
eat,” she said pettishly. “No, I don’t like him. He
frightens me.”</p>

<p>“How?” incredulously. Any other than Beryl she
would have turned from contemptuously if they had
dared to criticize Raimond Erle. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. But he wanted me to go out
in the yacht with him this afternoon, and I said I
wouldn’t without you. I wouldn’t go anywhere alone
with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“Without me! You said—Beryl, quick, what did you
call me? Not Andria?” white as death she stood over
the girl.</p>

<p>“No. I did slip and say Miss Heathcote, but I corrected
myself and said Miss Holbeach. Why do you
look like that? He didn’t notice. You don’t mean he
knows you?”</p>

<p>“Not now,” said Andria, holding herself hard. “He
did, once. What did he say when you slipped on my
name?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Half-shut his eyes like some people do
when they smell a nasty smell.”</p>

<p>“You’re more truthful than polite.”</p>

<p>“Well, you asked me, and that was exactly how he
did look. Mr. Egerton swam into the conversation with
something about ‘Miss Holbeach being my governess and
an excellent woman,’ and Mr. Erle looked comfortable
again.”</p>

<p>Andria did not wonder. “An excellent woman!” No
words could have been found that would have better set
Raimond at rest.</p>

<p>“Did he say any more?” she asked wretchedly.</p>

<p>Beryl turned crimson.</p>

<p>“No, he—he’s a beast, and I hate him!” she said passionately.
“He said he was glad I did not produce you
at meals; learned ladies took away his appetite.”</p>

<p>“I won’t interfere with it; he needn’t agitate himself!
Beryl, dear, don’t speak of me to him; don’t tell him my
Christian name, and don’t let Heathcote slip again. I
knew him once. I don’t want him to know I’m here. At
least,” hastily, “not now.”</p>

<p>Every pulse of her longed to meet him, but not before
Egerton and Beryl. If she was to go to England in
the same ship she must see him first, but it should be
no chance meeting before strangers.</p>

<p>“I won’t say a word about you,” and, with a rare
caress, she flung her arms round Andria’s neck—“if you
say not. Are you afraid of him, too?”</p>

<p>“No!” said Andria sharply. “I can’t meet any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
I ever knew till I’m better—that’s all. See how ugly
and swollen my throat is.”</p>

<p>“I hate you being hurt for me. I wish it had been me
that was bitten!” Beryl said, with more force than
grammar.</p>

<p>“Did you tell him about that?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t! I don’t believe he would have listened
if I had. He only talked nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean he made love to you? Bah! Don’t
answer me,” she cried, “I was a fool to ask. He would
make love to a girl who kept pigs, if she were pretty.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want him to think I’m pretty!” said Beryl,
ruffled as a cat stroked the wrong way, utterly ignorant
of the way she was betraying her own thoughts. “What
have you done about Mr. Heriot? Have you told?”</p>

<p>“No; I—waited!” answered Andria, with a ghastly
smile, knowing she had waited for what would never be.
“Beryl, come here, look! There go Mr. Egerton and—his
friend—down to the shore. What for, do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know? They’re not going to stay here.
They’re going to dine and sleep on board the yacht and
come back in the morning. And Mr. Erle isn’t his
friend—he’s his nephew. That’s why I came; I thought
we might go”—flushing—“and speak to Mr. Heriot.
Didn’t you get anything out of Mr. Egerton about our
going away? And did he say anything about that dreadful
man, and the jaguars?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Andria, as if she talked in her sleep. “I’ll
tell you by and by.” She leaned from the window looking
after the man whose shoulders and walk she would
know among a thousand. He knew nothing of her being
here. Beryl’s slip of “Heathcote” had been to him only
a disagreeable coincidence, reminding him of things he
wished to forget. Then, what had brought him?</p>

<p>“Beryl!” It was as if another person had spoken aloud
in her ear. “Egerton means to marry him to Beryl!”</p>

<p>She could think of no reason why, and yet she was
sure. And why not? For all she knew, Beryl Corselas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
might be any one’s daughter, and whatever her secret
history was, Egerton must know it.</p>

<p>“He’ll never do it, never! Whether I’m Raimond’s
wife or not, I’ll stop it,” she thought, wild passion at
her heart. “I’ll tell anything, everything. Mr. Heriot
will back me up——”</p>

<p>Beryl pinched her.</p>

<p>“What are you dreaming about, with your face all
screwed up?” she said. “Let’s go and see Mr. Heriot.
How those two men do loiter! If they’re going, why
don’t they go?”</p>

<p>Andria stared at her. Beryl—Raimond—Heriot—what
a tangle it was! And would Heriot back her up? He
knew nothing of her but that she had been called “the
Lovely Andria,” and had been thought to have fastened
like a leech on Raimond Erle, dragging him to that
financial ruin which had certainly overtaken him—though
not through her, Heaven knew! And when Heriot saw
Raimond here, he would never believe Andria was not
in the whole scheme, let it be what it might.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what he thinks!” she reflected swiftly.
“Nothing matters to me but Raimond. And I may be
wronging him. Egerton may be trying to keep me out
of his way.”</p>

<p>She turned impulsively to Beryl.</p>

<p>“Stay here,” she said impetuously, “wait for me. I
don’t know what to do. I must go and think.”</p>

<p>But it was not to think that she ran out into the gardens,
brushing by Salome, who tried to stop her in the
hall to say something—what, Andria neither knew nor
cared. Only one thing was in her mind—to find out why
Raimond Erle was here, if not for her. Why should
she believe Egerton; who had lied to her before?</p>

<p>The front door was in full view of the two men, who
stood talking still just where she had first seen them.
Andria ran to a disused side veranda and dropped down
on a flower-bed. She wanted no one to see her, least
of all Beryl from her window. She vanished into a
tangle of overgrown bushes that Beryl called “the cat’s
walk.” It cut the long road to the shore—that instinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
told her the two men would take—at a right angle, and
then ran parallel with it almost to the bay. There would
be only a yard of impervious thicket between her and
Raimond, if she got there in time to keep pace with him
as he walked down the wide road.</p>

<p>She did not care as she ran that it was nearly sunset,
and that those teeth that had marked her neck might not
be shaken off twice; she was not even breathless with her
breakneck pace as she reached the angle of the path.
She need only reach it, and whatever Raimond spoke of
she would hear.</p>

<p>“It’s low—contemptible!” she thought grimly, “but I
don’t care. I must find out what I can, and——” the
thought broke off unfinished. They were coming!</p>

<p>White-faced over her black dress, the governess, “that
excellent woman,” crouched behind the thicket of black
cypress that was all that stood between her and the man
who had been her husband.</p>

<p>And, sharpened as her senses were, she never dreamed
that two yards in front of her stood some one else,
equally quiet, but from widely different motives.</p>

<p>Raimond’s voice—how the woman’s heart burned in
her at the rich note of it!—came on her ears.</p>

<p>“You do hurry so unmercifully,” he was saying, “even
down to that confounded ship of yours. Why wouldn’t
you stay up there and sleep in a decent bed? Would
you mind waiting one instant? My cigar’s gone out.”</p>

<p>“Light it and be good enough to come on!” returned
Egerton sharply. “It’s nearly sunset, and I have no
desire to get fever. You can talk on the yacht.”</p>

<p>“Oh, damn the yacht! That cook has the same menu
every night. I wanted to see what your niggers would
give us for dinner.”</p>

<p>Andria heard a match struck, then another.</p>

<p>“Take my box,” said Egerton irritably, “and if you
must dawdle here, tell me what you mean to do. Isn’t
the girl handsome enough for you, or—you’re not still
thinking of that wretched woman in London!” said
Egerton suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Her? Oh, Lord, no! To be candid with you, I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
had enough of that; I wasn’t sorry to be well out of it.
She was a good-looking woman, though! But I was tired
of that house in Pont Street.”</p>

<p>“You told me the truth when you said you weren’t
fool enough to marry her?”</p>

<p>In the dead silence the woman they spoke of heard
the man she loved puffing at a cigar that would not
draw; more interested in that than in the question on
which her life seemed to hang. The screen of trees was
thick, but if either man had seen the face behind it he
would not have known the white mask of agony. Would
Raimond never answer? When he did, it was with a
laugh, and the governess, poor fool! winced.</p>

<p>“I was mad enough for anything—at first! When I
took her away from Lady Parr’s,” he said coolly. “But
I drew the line at that, more by good luck than good
management. At first I thought the marriage legal
enough, but then I found the man who did it was only
a student—no more ordained than you or I, though he’s
since become a priest. Oh, I’m perfectly eligible, my
dear sir,” with another slight laugh. “But though I see
excellent reasons for my marrying this particular girl,
I’m not in much haste. She looks too much of a tiger-cat,
for one thing! Now, the late Mrs. Erle had faults,
but she was never more gentle than when she was in a
furious rage.”</p>

<p>“What became of her?” asked Egerton shortly.</p>

<p>“Don’t know, and don’t care. I don’t see why you
should, either, when you were always at me to get rid
of her. But that’s beside the question. What you don’t
seem to see is that you can’t hurry this girl. She shies
off if I look at her. You’re always too nippy. You
shoved her off here to get rid of her, and then tore
your hair because you’d done it. Let me remind you,
it was I put you on her track in the first place; without
me, you’d never have put a finger on her. You chose
to treat me as a fool, and sneaked her off here. Then
when you see that a certain Spanish grandee is dead and—oh,
don’t interrupt me; there is not a soul about—has
left all his money to a certain lady or her heirs, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
those heirs are being advertised for, you fall on my neck
and beseech me to save your credit and your acres. Well,
it suits me well enough! I fancy the girl. But I’m
going to do it in my own way. So far, I beg to tell you,
you’ve made a mess of it, in yours.”</p>

<p>“Raimond!” the man’s voice was furious. “Don’t play
the fool, don’t dare. You don’t know all that hangs on
it. It’s not the money only, nor even the succession,
it’s——” his voice dropped so low that even Andria,
whose very soul was listening, could not hear.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Erle, startled for once. “But she dare
not tell, there!”</p>

<p>“No; we’ve got her in our hands in a way—but only
in a way. She—Mother Felicitas, they call her now,”
with that uncontrollable, jarring laugh of his, “has long
claws! She will want the money, too, to go to the convent—and
the Lord knows she’ll have to pay well for
her seat in heaven!”</p>

<p>“But why,” said Raimond, stupefied, “if you knew
about her all along, didn’t you have her out of the convent
long ago?”</p>

<p>“With publicity—back debts to pay up—to take you
or leave you as seemed good to the half-fledged brat!
No! And I couldn’t have got her. If you will have it,
I’d been taken in. That woman held her over my head
till I found her—and I didn’t know about the money till
I got back from here. Before that, if I’d claimed her,
I’d have brought out old stories, ruined myself, ousted
you or saddled you with a penniless wife.”</p>

<p>“Whereas, now, I’m made or marred by what a pale
little devil with cat’s eyes chooses to answer me,” replied
Raimond coarsely. “Well, there’s no choice! I’ll marry
her if she says yes to my somewhat mature charms. If
she says no, I fail to see what’s to be done next!”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Egerton angrily, “you’ve less sense than
I imagined. Why do you suppose I hired a yacht with
money I haven’t got, and brought her and you to this
God-forsaken hole? If she says no, she can live and die
here. She’ll never get back to England, and she doesn’t
know who she is in any case. I should fancy it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
simple as A B C. We’ll lose the money, but we’ll save
the rest.”</p>

<p>Raimond Erle for a long minute said nothing. The
wretched listener who shrank appalled behind the screen
of cypress could not see that he was looking the other
man up and down.</p>

<p>“Well,” he remarked at last, “you must have been a
daredevil when you were young! But I quite agree
with you. There’s only one character in which your protégée
can be taken to England, but you must give me a
little time to play the game. Come on out of this,” with
sudden distaste. “I don’t know why, but I feel as if
there were devils behind every bush in your secluded
retreat.”</p>

<p>“There’s one; oh, there’s one!” said Andria Heathcote,
who knew now that she had never been Andria
Erle, though she had hoped against hope even when she
was turned out on the world with ten pounds. “I’ll ruin
you—ruin you! If there’s a God in heaven, you shall
never have Beryl to torture as you tortured me!”</p>

<p>A thousand slights, a thousand dreadful positions he
had put her in where she must hold up her head till
women called her brazen—aye, and men, too!—came back
to her. One kindly word, one pitying regret for the
woman he had once been mad for, and she might have
played into his hands for no other reason than that he
had spoken of her softly for old sake’s sake. But now—she
could hate him now!</p>

<p>Blindly, not seeing or caring where she was going, she
stumbled forward on the rough path, and round the very
next bush nearly fell against—Heriot!</p>

<p>Pale, quivering from head to foot, she stood quite
still. For a moment she could not speak for the ungovernable
fury of rage in her that he should have heard
her shamed.</p>

<p>“You listened!” she cried at last. “You heard.” In
the last low rays of the sinking sun he stood before her
bareheaded.</p>

<p>“I slipped out for some air,” he said, very low. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
stood here because I did not want them to see me till
I knew what you had done. Yes, I heard.”</p>

<p>If he had dared to pity her she would have stood like
a stone, but now something in his voice reached the heart
that felt frozen in her breast. She broke into such a
dreadful sobbing as he had never heard.</p>

<p>“I knew it before,” she cried; “though I wouldn’t believe
it. Even when he turned me away, I wouldn’t
believe it. I thought I was his wife. He shall never have
Beryl—never, unless he kills me to get her!”</p>

<p>“Come back to the house. It is too late to be out,”
was all Heriot could find to say. He turned away that
he might not see the shame and agony in her distorted
face.</p>

<p>“He whispered,” she cried, distracted. “I couldn’t
hear. Why, besides the money, does his uncle want him
to marry her?”</p>

<p>“His uncle!” Heriot exclaimed. He was glad as he
had not often been that he had heard all that had been
said, or not for a hundred oaths from her would he have
believed this woman knew nothing of the dirty work Erle
had on hand. And he had wronged her enough by judging
her. If it had not been for his self-righteousness she
would have told him everything long ago. “That wasn’t
his uncle. That was his father, Lord Erceldonne! He
is not Egerton at all.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE CRY IN THE STARLIGHT.</p>


<p>“Erceldonne!” the world swam with her.</p>

<p>For how many years had that name been her terror,
its owner her evil genius. Sometimes it had been clear
even to her blinded eyes that his anger was used as a
pretext for not acknowledging her, and again she had
known when he had really put pressure on his son, and
nothing but a dogged, cross-grained temper had kept
Raimond from giving her up. And here she was taking
his money, the paid servant of the man who had ruined
her life; for if it had not been for the fear of disinheritance,
Raimond would have married her openly in the days
when love was young. And Erceldonne——</p>

<p>To Heriot’s horror, she broke out into a harsh scream
of laughter. What would Erceldonne say if he knew
the very woman he had been at his wit’s end to get rid
of had been brought by his own accord under his very
roof? She turned to Heriot, wiping away the tears born
of that horrible, mirthless laughter.</p>

<p>“What a merry-andrew patchwork it is!” she cried.
“‘Three blind mice, see how they run’—now you come
in, and then Raimond and the others; we’re all in the
dreadful round. And by and by the farmer’s wife will
come and cut all our tails off! Why don’t you laugh?”
she cried wildly.</p>

<p>He might have answered with perfect truth, because
there was nothing further from his mind than laughter.
Here in the fast-growing gloom of the cypress thicket,
where Andria’s face was already but a patch of white
against the dark foliage, they were half a mile from the
house; and he knew now what the dangers were in this
place after nightfall. The very man who had brought
two women here had not cared to stay and face them.</p>

<p>“What a fool I was to lie low!” he thought angrily.
“If I had appeared at first everything would have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
to be open and aboveboard. Now, I can’t come out after
slinking away as I did. I wonder why I listened to
that child?”</p>

<p>But he knew quite well why he had listened. From
the very first day her slow, soft voice, her strange eyes,
had bewitched him. It was for more than Andria’s sake
that he was aghast at the cold wickedness of the man
who was pleased to call himself Egerton.</p>

<p>“Come home, come back to the house!” he said
sharply. “We’ve only got to-night before us to settle
what we must do;” but in his mind there was, of course,
only one thing to be done. He must reckon with Erceldonne
in the morning.</p>

<p>He dared not even talk as he hurried his companion
up the path. His foot was stiff still, though his strength
had come back to him; but no man’s strength and his
bare hands were going to avail anything against a madman
and two jaguars; and the woman at his side would
welcome death as a friend.</p>

<p>If he had been alone he would have returned to the
house with his hands in his pockets—he could only die
once, and life was not so sweet to a broken man that he
should worry about it. But with this silent, listless
woman on his hands, Heriot’s heart was in his mouth at
every strange shadow in the ever-deepening dark. When
they were free of the woods he felt easier. The good
stars shone down on them as they reached the open garden
and drew near the house, and a quick compassion
ran through him for Andria Erle, whose only refuge was
under the roof of her enemy.</p>

<p>“Look! What’s that?” he said quietly. “Let me go
first.”</p>

<p>“There’s no need,” returned Andria lifelessly. “If
you mean that black thing in the shadow by the steps,
it’s Salome. She’s waiting for me; she saw me go out.”</p>

<p>The woman came to them swiftly, her finger on her
lips.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak,” she said softly; “Chloe’s in de dining-room.
Oh, my Lawd! I didn’t know where you was
both got to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“Send her away,” whispered Andria, with sudden passion.
“Tell her you’ll wait on me, anything!” She would
go mad if she had to sit through dinner alone, if Heriot
must hide when there was so little time to make a plan.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her and ’Melia Jane dey must iron dem two
white dresses for Miss Ber’l to-night. Dey won’t be no
more’n time, and when dey gits out in de wash-house,”
she said shrewdly, “dey’ll be skeered to come in again.
Dey’ll sneak up-stairs to deir beds.”</p>

<p>“Anything, only be quick!” Heriot should stay where
he was till he heard all she had to say; all the dreadful
tale Egerton had let out about Beryl, without knowing
that she was putting two and two together. “Lock them
out, Salome,” she added feverishly.</p>

<p>“Yes’m! You come into de house, de two of you.
Just you sit in de drawing-room an’ don’t speak till I
tell you dey’s gone.”</p>

<p>Heriot had almost to push Andria in. It seemed as
if she courted death out under the stars.</p>

<p>When he had bolted the heavy door noiselessly, he
followed her into the dark drawing-room. What was
Salome doing that she was so long? He heard her voice
in the back of the house; not raised in authority, but wild
with astonishment and fright. Before he could draw
breath, the fat black woman had thrown open the dining-room
door, her shapeless figure grotesque against the
lighted dinner-table as she stared into the gloom where
the two sat.</p>

<p>“Oh, missus,” she said, “missus! And dem niggers
never told me.”</p>

<p>“Told you what?” cried Andria. Heriot, with that
open door in front of him dared not speak.</p>

<p>“Little miss is gone out. Dat man, de tall one, wid
de marks o’ de devil’s claws round his eyes, he come back
for her. He said you was waiting for her down at de
shore, you was both going to dinner on de yacht. An’
she’s went wid him, after last night. Dey’ll be et.”</p>

<p>Heriot let out an astonished oath. If it had not been
for that stupid lie about the governess and his private
knowledge, it might have seemed natural enough that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Beryl should dine on the yacht. But Andria’s wits were
quicker, and she knew Raimond Erle.</p>

<p>He had been bored with his father’s society, and must
have come straight back by the short cut. The girl was
handsome. Even without getting her on board the
<i>Flores</i>, a starlight walk with her would pass the time.
That lie about the governess had been told when she
refused to go with him; it was the first thing he would
think of. She knew how obstinate he was about anything
he might take in his head. He knew nothing about
the dangers of the island; if he did, recklessness and a
revolver would make him laugh at them. A beautiful
girl, whom he must make love to for reasons he had
seen fit to exclaim at; a night warm and silent, heavy
with flower scents, the soft stars ablaze in the sky!—his
discarded wife clenched her teeth. Not anything on earth
would have balked Raimond of his evening walk.</p>

<p>“But I will!” she cried to herself, wild and bitter in
her rebellion. “I, that he shamed and turned out,” she
fumbled blindly on a table in the dark.</p>

<p>“I must go,” she said, with something cold and dreadful
in her voice that Salome took for fear, like her own.
“If he said I was at the shore, I’ll be there. There will
be time by the short cut.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you do it! You won’t do no good,” cried
the black woman. “Mr. Egerton he’ll take care of little
miss—if ever she gets to de boat!”</p>

<p>“He’ll take such care of her that she’ll never come
back,” Andria muttered.</p>

<p>Yet it was not fear for the girl that was in her heart,
but the jealousy that is more cruel than the grave. No
one knew as she did what Raimond could be when he
chose. She did not believe for one instant that any girl
could resist him. She was past Heriot like a flash, regardless
of anything but those two walking down to the
shore in the scented night, under the gorgeous stars—a
man and a maid.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” Heriot was at her side. “Did you think
I wasn’t coming? Though I don’t see what good either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
of us can do if she’s gone on board the yacht. What’s
that?”</p>

<p>His hand, swinging against hers as they walked, had
touched something cold and sharp. Before she knew
what she was doing it was in his grasp, not hers. In the
starlight he saw what it was.</p>

<p>“This will do to fight the jaguars with,” he said coolly,
pocketing the lean, ugly dagger just as if he had not
seen her face in the square patch of light from the dining-room
door as she ran past him. “I’ll attend to that, if
you’ll catch your charge. Hold on, that’s not the way!”</p>

<p>“It’s the way I’m going,” she replied savagely.</p>

<p>She began to run as once before she had run down
that path; every turn of it seemed familiar to her, even
in the veiled light. She took no more thought for Heriot
than if he had been a dog; he had the dagger; let him
take care of himself.</p>

<p>Round the great boulders, through the thickets of
flowers, she fled as one possessed; hatred at her heart,
jealousy tearing her. Heriot, stumbling over the tough,
trailing vines, missing the dim track a hundred times,
was soon far behind. The more he hurried, the less he
got on. He had taken the dagger from her because he
had seen red murder in her eyes, yet now he almost
wished she had it. He knew from instinct that there
was more abroad in the woods than Raimond Erle and
the girl he had decoyed away. Yet not a sound reached
him as he doggedly followed the governess. He gave a
sudden, contemptuous laugh at himself for being mixed
up in such a wild-goose chase—and at Erle, who had
had to cajole a girl to go with him by a lie! The next
instant he laughed no longer.</p>

<p>He was out of the wooded path on the open shore.
Before him was the dark figure of Andria Erle, standing
motionless; as he came up to her she pointed dumbly.</p>

<p>The moon had risen, and perfectly distinct on the
calm waves of the bay was a boat with a solitary figure
in it, a man rowing with a quick, ill-tempered stroke.</p>

<p>“She left him. She hasn’t gone with him!” Heriot
exclaimed. “But where is she?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Andria, with chattering
teeth. What would have seemed nothing in another place
was eery here, after the strange story of that other girl
who sang to animals. And yet her heart was lighter as
she turned away. It was something, at least, that Beryl
had not gone to the yacht.</p>

<p>But now that her passion of rage and fear was dead,
she dared not go back to the house by that path she had
been warned not to use in broad daylight. It was by
the long way that she hurried Heriot to the house; yet
it was he, not she, who was nervous about the girl who
had gone back alone. If Egerton’s tale were true, neither
the madman nor his dreadful familiars would hurt Beryl;
but still Andria winced when they reached the house and
found she had not come in.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” She sat down on the door-steps
sick at heart.</p>

<p>“Go and look for her. At least, I will. You stay
here,” but he had not gone twenty yards when he recoiled.</p>

<p>“Did you call?” he cried sharply.</p>

<p>“No one did,” but through her words there came the
echo of a faint cry, low and wailing like a lost soul.</p>

<p>Heriot, running as if he had been shot out of a gun,
made for the moonlit woods.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE MADMAN.</p>


<p>He might well have run at that cry, for nothing but
sheer terror had forced it from Beryl Corselas.</p>

<p>Half from real dislike of the man, half from wanton
mischief, she had dexterously slipped away from Erle
and vanished like a spirit into an opening in the thick
bush. Full of laughter, she had run and doubled like a
hare, while he crashed after her through the scrub, till,
angry and crestfallen, he had flung himself into his boat
and departed.</p>

<p>Breathless, Beryl sat down on a convenient stone and
chuckled.</p>

<p>“How cross he was! And that was a horrid lie about
Andria expecting me. But he has lovely eyes, and he is—yes,
he is amusing! But I don’t think I like him. I
don’t like men at all,” she said, with sudden gravity. “I
hate Mr. Egerton, for I don’t believe a word he says, and
Mr. Heriot treats me like a child. Mr. Erle doesn’t do
that.” She got up crossly and began to saunter homeward.
She was almost sorry she had not gone with Erle
in spite of that lie. It was dull at home, where Heriot
seemed only to care to talk to Andria.</p>

<p>“I never would have stirred a foot with Mr. Erle if
Andria and Mr. Heriot had not gone off and left me
like that,” she thought, with an unreasonable lump in her
throat, her short-lived joy at having outwitted Erle all
gone.</p>

<p>It was pitch-dark in the woods as she began to walk
back to the house. She had run and doubled so that
she was not too sure where she was, and an uneasy feeling
came over her that she was not on the right path.
There was a queer rustling, too, in the bushes, and she
listened, her heart going like a frightened bird’s.</p>

<p>“It must be my cats,” she thought determinedly, and
with a voice that was not too steady she began her queer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
calling croon. But not a stealthy footstep sounded anywhere;
no yellow-green eyes looked from the bushes; no
cubs bounded from the black underbrush. Instead there
fell in the wood a sudden, deathlike silence, far more
threatening to the girl than the sight of those beasts who
were tame for all their fierce looks.</p>

<p>“The man!” Her heart gave a rending bound. “That
crazy, jabbering man. And he’s hunting me!”</p>

<p>Wild with terror she looked round her, and had no idea
which way to run. She was lost, alone in the trackless
scrub; it was so dark she could not even see where she
walked. And only one thing could keep the cats away if
there were in sound of her call—their master’s voice that
was stronger than hers, meaningless jabber though it
was.</p>

<p>In desperation she pushed straight before her, tearing
through the thick bushes; stumbling, great drops of
perspiration on her face from the airless heat. As she
crashed forward, making noise enough to wake the dead,
her ears caught above all the sounds of crackling branches
and tearing vines that slight, slight rustling, as of feet
that were keeping pace with her, very close beside her.</p>

<p>She turned sharply and burst through a screen of
bushes, to find herself standing by the clear pool she had
seen one morning. The moon shone down as bright as
day, after the dreadful darkness of the woods the clear
sheet of water looked like home; and then she screamed,
a long, wailing shriek that had turned Heriot cold.</p>

<p>At her side, almost touching her, was the apelike thing
that had bitten Andria to the bone. The next instant its
long claws of fingers were on hers. In utter despair she
shut her eyes and waited for the horror that was coming.
Would the thing tear her limb from limb?</p>

<p>But except for that hand on hers it was not touching
her, and as she stood, sick and stony with fear, a hoarse
voice spoke to her.</p>

<p>“Dearest of my soul,” it said in Spanish; “dearest of
my soul.”</p>

<p>With a cry of astonishment she opened her eyes. The
man was not dumb, then, nor utterly dangerous! For he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
was down on his knees by her, kissing the hem of her
garment. The soft language she had learned by stealth
in the convent came back to her like a flash.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” she cried. “What do you want?
Why do you frighten us so?”</p>

<p>“You have come home; come back to me!” The voice
was the voice of an old man, the kneeling figure pitifully
thin and ragged. “I am the old man who loves you—don’t
you remember me? It was I gave you that ring!”
He touched the green beryl on her finger pleadingly.</p>

<p>She stared at him; yet she dared not say she had found
the ring.</p>

<p>“You frightened me, you hurt my governess last
night,” she cried angrily. “Go away and let me alone!”</p>

<p>“I did not know you liked her. I thought she was his
servant,” the old man whimpered. He began to beg her
pardon a hundred times.</p>

<p>“I to frighten you, I that love you!” he cried. “I will
never touch a hair of any one that belongs to you. I’ll
never leave you again.”</p>

<p>“You must go away—and never come back,” cried
Beryl, stamping her foot, seeing no meaning in the words
Andria would have understood too well.</p>

<p>The thing crouched at her feet.</p>

<p>“Little dearest, I will go,” said the broken old voice,
and tears of pity came to Beryl’s eyes. “But if he
comes,” it was fierce again, “call me and I will send him
away. He shall never steal you again.”</p>

<p>“Beryl! Where are you?” The sudden shout was
stern and yet anxious. “Answer me.”</p>

<p>Heriot’s voice. What should she do? She looked at
the crazy face beside her, in an instant all the humanity
had been wiped off it as the man scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p>“I will call my cats,” he whispered, with the leering
grin that had terrified Andria. “They will claw him.”</p>

<p>“No!” she said hastily. She stooped and put her hand
on those bent, repulsive shoulders. “No. Listen—this
man who’s coming is my friend, look at him well. When
I call you, you and your cats can claw—but never him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
nor my governess. If you hurt them I’ll never let you
see me again.”</p>

<p>He winced pitifully.</p>

<p>“My soul is yours,” he said. “I will not come near
the house nor let the cats come—till you call us with the
song I taught you. I will keep away from the house.
But, <i>querida mia</i>, do not go with him again! This time
I will be quicker, and save you.”</p>

<p>“Go!” said the girl in a frantic whisper, hearing Heriot
breaking through the bushes. “Go, till I do call you.”</p>

<p>Almost as she spoke Heriot sprang out into the open
space. Was he dreaming, or did he see beside the girl in
her white gown a crouching thing like an ape?</p>

<p>He ran to her, round the pool. There should be an end
of this thing that hunted women! Mad or sane, the man
deserved no more mercy than a venomous beast. But as
he reached the girl he stopped short. She was absolutely
alone.</p>

<p>“Run to the house!” he cried. “That brute’s behind
you, and I’m going to finish him once for all. Did he
hurt you?” he cried savagely.</p>

<p>She lifted her face, and he saw she was crying.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she said as gently as Andria might. “Nothing
hurt me. And—there’s no one here!”</p>

<p>“But I saw him,” replied Heriot grimly. “And I heard
you scream.”</p>

<p>She laid a quick hand on his arm as he would have
passed her.</p>

<p>“There’s no one here; if there was, he’s gone,” she
said. “I did not mean to scream. Did I frighten Andria?”</p>

<p>“What was it?” he insisted almost roughly, for he was
certain he had seen that crouching, wizened figure at her
side, though there was no sign of it now, nor even a leaf
stirring in the warm moonlight.</p>

<p>Instead of answering she looked him in the face with
the moonlight full on her strange, tawny eyes till they
looked like wells of light, deep and golden. Something in
them seemed to strike him like a blow. Yesterday they
had been a child’s eyes, careless, almost shallow. To-night—Heriot’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
heart began to pound. The girl had
come into her birthright of womanhood, of a marvelous
witchery that would be a snare to the feet of men.</p>

<p>“What made you scream, Beryl?” and this time he did
not speak as to a child. “Tell me.”</p>

<p>“I lost myself. It was dark. I meant to call, and I
suppose I screamed.” She could not tell the truth, for
the old shame that was on her that beasts and strange
creatures loved and obeyed her.</p>

<p>“Why did you leave Erle?” though Heaven knew it
was no business of his! “You were in his charge. What
did he mean by letting you come back by yourself?”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t help it,” she said, with a laugh in her
eyes. “I led him a dance, you know. He went away disgusted,
for he couldn’t find me.”</p>

<p>“Do you like him?” asked Heriot. There was a curious
look in the handsome face that had seldom darkened for
any woman’s words.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Beryl, with provocation. “When
I find out shall I tell you?”</p>

<p>There was the faintest stir in the thicket, and suddenly
Heriot knew that whatever the evening’s adventures had
been she did not mean him to know them.</p>

<p>“Oh, I!” he said lightly; “just as you like.” He led
the way up the path in silence till they reached the open
ground and could see the house.</p>

<p>“I’ll watch you safely in,” and he took off his cap;
“you’ll be all right from here. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming to dinner? They won’t be back.”</p>

<p>“No!” he returned, for to be hidden in Erceldonne’s
house and eat his bread any longer was impossible.</p>

<p>“You had better. You won’t see us much longer,” she
said coolly. “Do you know Mr. Egerton’s going to take
us away?”</p>

<p>“If——” he stopped himself. It was no business of his.
If she chose to marry Erle, regardless of his past and
Andria’s, that was her affair. Till Andria told her, he
had no right to.</p>

<p>“If what?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he said awkwardly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“You are treating me like a child again, just as I had
begun to like you!” she cried pettishly, and the very
childlike ring of her voice appealed to him. Yet he stood
utterly silent.</p>

<p>If he, a broken man, a penniless adventurer, should
make love to a girl who eavesdropping had told him was
an heiress, the thing would not be called by a pretty
name. He did not care two straws for the mystery about
her if only she were the waif she seemed.</p>

<p>“Yet after all,” he thought swiftly, “even a broken-down
devil like me would make her a better husband
than Erle—supposing he’s free, which I don’t believe!
Because she may have money and I have none am I going
to hand her over to the first roué who wants her? By
George! I’m going to do no such thing.” But even he
dared not tell her what he knew about Raimond Erle.</p>

<p>In the moonlight she stepped to his side like a lovely
ghost, and as she brushed him in passing, a quick rapture
ran through him. There was no sense in reasoning, he
loved her—for life and death and the world to come. At
a word from her he would sweep Erle and his father from
her path like straws. He would not tell her the trap she
was in, she must choose for herself freely and without
bias. But he would not let her go. If she should learn
to love Erle—and Heaven knew why, but many women
did—what would she feel when Andria made the scene
she was sure to do?</p>

<p>“Why don’t you speak?” she broke out petulantly. “I
know what you’re thinking—that if Mr. Egerton is going
to take us away you’re going to start off through the bush
to-night and try for the town there is across the island!
You’re going to wash your hands of Andria and me.”</p>

<p>“What else can I do, if you’re going back with him?”
and his voice was utterly grim.</p>

<p>“You can go with us.”</p>

<p>“In the first place I wouldn’t go, and in the second
they wouldn’t take me. No; if you’re going in the yacht
I should be off to-night, if it weren’t for leaving you and
Mrs.—Miss Holbeach to that crazy brute I let in last
night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>The girl recoiled as if he had struck her. Heriot
cursed himself for having haggled at Andria’s name. But
it was not that.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Beryl, with a sob of shame, “he won’t
come! He’ll never come any more, nor his cats, either.
Don’t speak to me, don’t ask me why, Andria knows,” she
was crying bitterly, “that all queer animals and things
come to me. And I met him to-night, and I did scream,
though I told you a lie! He was so old—and so pitiful—I
couldn’t let you hurt him. But he was there all the
time I said he was gone.”</p>

<p>“Darling!” said Heriot softly. “Little brave darling,
don’t cry.” He put his arm round the bowed shoulders
as gently as a woman, and with as self-forgetful a tenderness.
He knew no other girl would have pitied a man
who filled her with terror, who had bitten like a beast before
her eyes only last night.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry!” he repeated. “And why do you mind that
animals trust you and miserable things come to you? I
loved you for it the very first day I saw you.”</p>

<p>“Mother Felicitas said I wasn’t human! I was half a
beast,” she sobbed. “And it makes me afraid of—who I
am.”</p>

<p>“Beryl, look at me,” said the man softly.</p>

<p>She stopped crying; just in time, if she had known it,
to keep her sobs from jealous ears close by.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” Heriot said, “why things like that
trust you? Because you love them and have no fear of
them. I would give half my life to have dumb animals
come to me as they do to you. Don’t you know that no
wild thing will come to any one who isn’t so good that
they know it?”</p>

<p>“No!” she whispered.</p>

<p>He nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“There is something else just as true,” he said very
low. “I love you, too,” he stooped his handsome head
and kissed her hands.</p>

<p>At the light touch of his lips she shivered.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” he whispered. For his life he could
not speak above his breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“You can’t!” she cried. “No one does but Andria.”</p>

<p>“Look at me,” he repeated more gently than ever, and
as she raised her eyes the sweetness and truth in his overmastered
her. “Tell me, can’t you love me—only a
little?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know;” but she had loved him madly, jealously,
since the very day he came. “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I think you do.” He had seen her eyes. “Beryl!”</p>

<p>She clung to him suddenly.</p>

<p>“They would murder you! Salome said so. Oh! take
me away from this place—from Mr. Egerton.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try!” said Heriot soberly. And suddenly the task
before him flashed out in its true colors. He realized that
unless he could be outwitted Erceldonne would kill the
girl before he let her get away.</p>

<p>“You can do it if you want to!” Somehow she was
disappointed, taken aback. The slow words that were so
much better than a rash promise had chilled her almost
to distrust. Before he could answer she had broken away
from him and was scudding across the grass to the house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE LAUGH IN THE DARK.</p>


<p>A weakness like the lethargy that comes before death
had bound Andria hand and foot. Where she had sunk
down on the door-step she stayed, caring nothing for the
dark shadows of the garden, or the beasts, and worse,
that might be hidden in them.</p>

<p>Raimond had left Beryl and gone to the yacht—that
was the only thing really in her thoughts. But he would
not be so balked a second time. It would be better if
death came and took her where she sat, found Beryl in
the lonely woods, for it would cut the coil around them
both, the coil the girl understood not at all—the woman
too well. She bowed her head on the cold stone door-steps,
too hopeless to care how the matter ended.</p>

<p>The moon rose and poured a flood of light on the
lovely, desolate figure, almost lying on the steps with hidden
face. Her misery, her shame that another had heard,
had numbed the woman’s wits. Raimond was done with
her, would care no more for her claim on him than for
his last year’s neckties. If Beryl fell in love with him she
might not care either. Andria could not think past that,
except to be sure that she would never leave the island,
even if she chose to go in the yacht with Raimond and
the girl who was to stand lawfully in her own unlawful
shoes.</p>

<p>A sudden touch roused her. Salome, like a black
statue, was sitting beside her.</p>

<p>“I been down in de woods,” she whispered. “I seen
him kiss her. She’s coming now. Oh, missus, dey’ll be
murder!”</p>

<p>“Seen who?” fierce, suddenly alive in every nerve, she
sprang up. Had she been mistaken, and it was not Raimond
she had seen rowing away! “For God’s sake, Salome,
who?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot,” but she sprang up, too, at the dreadful
laugh that came from Andria. “Don’t do like dat for de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
land’s sake!” she exclaimed. “Dey ain’t never no good
come from dat kind o’ laughin’. And I tell you he must
go out o’ dis to-night. Mr. Egerton he tell me Miss Ber’l
gwine to marry dat nephew he brung. What’ll he say
when he finds out?—for she’ll never marry him now, dat
I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Salome!” the white woman seized the black one’s
hand, more relieved than if she had brought her the riches
of the world. “What a fool I’ve been. I never thought
of that. Hush! Here’s Miss Beryl now. But—she’s
alone!”</p>

<p>Yet as she looked at the girl’s face in the warm moonlight
she knew Salome was right. The indifferent child
of yesterday was gone. This was a woman, and surely,
surely, she would fight as women do, tooth and claw, for
the man she loved.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mr. Heriot?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>“Coming.” She hesitated. “Andria——”</p>

<p>“I know,” a wave of pity came over her for the girl
whose wooing would be so stormy, and then a cold terror.
Salome knew Egerton—she knew Raimond—neither
would hesitate in this lonely island at anything that would
put out of the way the man and woman who threatened
their schemes. She looked up and saw Heriot approaching
as carelessly as if the terrors of the place did not
exist, and the foolhardy thing they were all doing came
over her.</p>

<p>“Come in; it isn’t safe to sit here,” she cried, and as
Beryl broke from her at the coming steps she turned to
Salome. “Take her in and put her to bed. Make her
eat something,” she whispered. “I’ll talk to him.”</p>

<p>Salome nodded.</p>

<p>“Make him go,” she breathed. “Get him out o’ dis.
Dey’ll murder him if dey finds out. It ain’t no use his
wantin’ to marry her nor trying to fight for her. Dey’ll
just walk plunk over him, and all she’ll ever know is dat
he ain’t come back some morning.”</p>

<p>She shambled off after the girl, but there was tragedy
in her working face.</p>

<p>From old, old times she had known that there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
way but giving in with Egerton. If the girl were meant
for his nephew he would have her in spite of ten Heriots
and without an open refusal.</p>

<p>“Come in,” repeated Andria, as Heriot stood irresolute
in the doorway. “I think we must all be mad to stay out
of doors after last night.”</p>

<p>She spoke with an irrepressible shiver; he looked so
handsome and debonair, and the odds against him were
so great.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not go into Erceldonne’s house,” he hesitated,
“but there’s so much to say. And you can’t stay
out here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you can either,” he said dryly.</p>

<p>Then Beryl had said nothing! But there had been no
time. And after all, why should he trust their safety to
a madman’s word?</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” he returned irrelevantly, entering and
fastening the door. “Look here. I—I wonder if you’ll
think I’ve behaved like a blackguard? I don’t know. I
mean to marry that girl, and I haven’t one farthing to
rub against another, while she—you heard what Erceldonne
said about her?”</p>

<p>“You told her so?”</p>

<p>“Not about the money, nor anything but myself. I—oh,
it’s been a mad evening! Do you know she saw that
crazy old man and spoke to him?”</p>

<p>“Then she did scream!” said Andria sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes: but when I got there she had tamed him as she
tamed the jaguars. He could have killed her, but instead
she says he promised not to hurt us any more.”</p>

<p>Andria turned swiftly away from the lamp that he
might not see her face as Egerton’s story about the madman
came back to her. The remembrance of all it must
mean chilled her to the bone.</p>

<p>“Begin at the beginning,” she temporized. “How did
she get away from——” she could not say the name. She
sat silent as he obeyed. If Egerton’s story were true,
that jabbering lunatic’s daughter must have been Beryl’s
mother! And yet, how could she tell it to Heriot?</p>

<p>A queer, dull passion rose in her and seemed to choke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
down the words she would have tried, perhaps, to say.
Heriot was all that really stood between Raimond and
Beryl—let him find out her history for himself.</p>

<p>“Besides, I don’t believe it!” she thought, and knew she
lied. She scarcely dared look up lest he might ask if she
knew who the crazy creature was that haunted the place.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot,” she said quickly, “you’re in earnest about
Beryl?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered very quietly, but she saw his mouth
tighten. “What right Erceldonne has to her I don’t
know, but it isn’t any better than mine. As for her being
rich,” with a quick, sweet laugh, “when I get her away
from here I’ll never inquire about her fortune.”</p>

<p>“Or her people?” She could not keep in the dangerous
question.</p>

<p>“I don’t care who she is as long as she’s my wife.”
But she could not salve her conscience with the answer;
she knew he would care. “Once we’re out of this, and
I’ve settled with her delightful friends down there”—with
a motion of his head toward the harbor.</p>

<p>“You can’t settle with him!” said Andria quickly. “Do
you mean you are going to meet them in the morning?”</p>

<p>“I fail to see any other way,” he replied, laughing.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Do you know what facing them would mean?” There
was an indescribable flatness in her voice. “None of us
would ever get away from the island, except perhaps
Beryl, and what would become of her I know better than
you.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t marry her against her will,” he said
shortly. “And as for carrying her off, he couldn’t keep
her. There is a law in England.”</p>

<p>“There’s no law for the dead—I mean you and I could
never rescue her, for we—they would never let us leave
this island alive! You, because you love the girl; I because——”
but she could not go on, and he knew well
enough that a deserted and discarded woman would get
short rope from Raimond Erle.</p>

<p>She was right, of course; an open struggle would be
madness. Erle and Erceldonne he might manage, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
yacht’s crew could easily overpower a man who had no
revolver. And yet he ached to try the fight.</p>

<p>Andria looked at him, with hot, smarting eyes.</p>

<p>“Twenty to one,” she said slowly. “Three of them you
might account for, with my dagger, and then you would
tell no tales! And Beryl, married to Raimond, would kill
herself.”</p>

<p>“What else can I do?”</p>

<p>“Go away,” she said very gently. “No, don’t look like
that!” for he was staring at her as if she had lost her
senses. “You think I would play into Raimond’s hands
if you did? You don’t know women! If he had loved
me still I might have been his willing tool, I’m bad
enough for that. But now”—her voice sank to an ugly
whisper—“I’m all hatred for him; when I think of him I
burn like fire. I only live to thwart him, to pay some of
an old score. Oh! talk of something else!” she cried, with
a sudden wild outbreak. “It is nothing to you that I
wake at night and long to kill him with my hands.”</p>

<p>Heriot turned his eyes away from her ashy face. Once
he would have laughed at believing in that Andria Erle
whose name had been a byword, but he trusted her now.
If he had trusted her before this night all might have been
safely away by this time. But as it was he knew her
broken heart and her broken pride would fight a better
battle for the girl he loved than all his strength could do.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?” he asked. “You have
a plan?”</p>

<p>Andria nodded.</p>

<p>“I want you to go and find a village and get a boat.
You are the only one who can do it. But you must go
alone, for if you took Beryl and me, even if we reached a
town Egerton’s steamer would be there before us and cut
us off. He knows every inch of the island. He’d guess
where we were going—that is, if there’s a town to get at,
as Salome says.”</p>

<p>“There must be,” he answered quickly. “This is either
Flores or Corvo, I don’t know which. But on the eastern
side of each there’s a town.”</p>

<p>“Across the mountain?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. Santa Cruz in Flores, Rosario in Corvo; either
would do. But I think this is Flores. We left Fayal for
Grasiosa and were blown off our course by a southeast
wind. The boat must have gone to pieces on the southeast
point of Flores—there was too much east in the wind
for Corvo.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll suppose we’re on the southwest side of
Flores. How far would it be to Santa Cruz?”</p>

<p>“Ten miles, as the crow flies. Twenty or more, allowing
for the mountain and no track. I could be there to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And get a boat and sail back. You could slip into
some little bay and come for us at dawn the day after, if
you’d had a fair wind. I’ll bring food, and we could hide
in some tiny inlet the yacht would never notice if they
sailed round the island till doomsday. Then when they
get tired and go, we can sail to Fayal. How far is it?”</p>

<p>“A hundred and fifty miles or so. You wouldn’t be
afraid in an open boat?”</p>

<p>“I’d take her away from him if we had to go on a
raft,” she said hardly. “Come and eat now, and then
you’d better go. Have you a compass?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want one. I can go by my watch and the sun.
You don’t think they’ll try to take you both while I’m
gone?”</p>

<p>“They won’t try to take me, and I don’t think they’ll
dare to hurry her so. Raimond will take his time, even in
making love. And he won’t find her very kind, if she’s
promised to marry you.”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t, in so many words.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Andria answered wearily. “She
means it. Come and eat; you must be on your way before
daylight. You’re not afraid of the man and his beasts?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid to leave you alone here for two days,” he
said shortly. “I tell you plainly I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>She had opened the door into the dining-room where
her neglected dinner stood cold on the table. Under the
bright light of the hanging lamp she turned on him with
a wild passion that there was no gainsaying.</p>

<p>“Listen to me!” she cried—and if her face was ghastly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
over her black gown her red-brown hair shone like fire
and her eyes swayed him, for all their weariness and red
rims—“listen to me. The girl is yours, but the man is
mine! It is my quarrel, and I will settle my debts for
myself. If you stay you may kill him before you’re killed
yourself, if it comes to main force; but do you think it is
death I want for the man who’s killed all the good in me?
I want more than that. I want him to live, with all his
schemes ruined; to suffer as he has made me suffer; to
starve as he turned me out to starve. If he gets the girl
he will have to kill me first—I, that was bone of his bone!
But it won’t come to that. I’ll put him off. I’ll make
Beryl make time; I’ll tell her my secret that has ruined
me, body and soul. But there won’t be any need before
you’re back,” and with a sudden listlessness she sat down
at the table. “Eat his meat and drink his wine; it will be
as good a weapon against him as a revolver,” she said,
with an evil look in her half-closed eyes. But he knew it
was not she, but what a man had made her, that had
taught her that look.</p>

<p>“I’ve no money,” he began shamefacedly.</p>

<p>“I have. Salome’s wages,” and she drew a roll of gold
out of her pocket. “Salome’s wages for Erceldonne’s
work!” but her laugh made Heriot wince.</p>

<p>“I’ll go now!” he said, pushing back his plate. “Tell
her!”</p>

<p>Andria could only nod.</p>

<p>She was helping Beryl to freedom and happiness, and
to what was she helping herself? Only to the just payment
for her broken life. Even Mother Benedicta could
not blame her.</p>

<p>“So,” she said, very low; “the dawn is coming. But
be quick. I can’t promise to protect her for more than
three days.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be back in one—at dawn to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Andria sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she whispered. “Did you hear anything?”</p>

<p>Heriot shook his head.</p>

<p>“You’re done up, tired out,” he returned gently.
“There’s nothing—not a sound!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>For sole answer she put out the light. He felt her
hand on his wrist as she led him in the dark across the
room and out on a disused veranda.</p>

<p>“Go this way, and be quick, quick!” she cried in the
same toneless whisper. “It’s the only chance to save her
now.”</p>

<p>She watched him as he ran across a narrow belt of
moonlight and disappeared in the blackness of the scrub.
Then, noiseless in her stocking feet, she searched every
inch of the wide veranda round the house.</p>

<p>There was no one there, no one in the garden. Her
wrought-up nerves must have deceived her, and it had
been fancy that she heard out of the darkness of the
veranda behind the dining-room Egerton’s uncontrollable,
cackling laugh.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A SEALED PACKET.</p>


<p>Reassure herself as she might, Andria fairly fled
through the empty passages to Beryl’s room.</p>

<p>“I’m worn out,” she thought; “I’m beginning to imagine
things. It couldn’t have been Egerton’s laugh I heard,
for he wouldn’t dare come here at night—and he couldn’t
have known he’d any reason to watch us.” But argue as
she liked, some sound had shaken her nerves till she dared
not strike a light lest some watcher outside might see.</p>

<p>“Beryl,” she said, standing by the girl’s bed in the dark,
“Beryl!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said a voice, “I’m here,” and Andria made out
a white figure by the window, and groped to the girl’s
side. “Something woke me, I thought. Andria, I
thought I heard a shot! Where’s Mr. Heriot?”</p>

<p>“A shot!” Andria turned cold, till she remembered she
had watched him safely out of sight and not a sound had
broken the stillness. “You couldn’t have,” she said,
bringing all her common sense to her aid; “you must have
been dreaming! He’s gone away, Beryl. I made him
go.”</p>

<p>“Gone! Where—what for?” she stared in the dark.</p>

<p>“I sent him. I was afraid to let him stay. Beryl, we’re
in a dreadful place. His going was the only chance to
save us.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean he’s to save us from?” cried Beryl,
stamping her bare foot. “If there’s anything to save us
from he’d better be here.” She was wild with misery.
That was what his half-hearted answer had meant, and he
did not care enough even to bid her good-by.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t do anything here. They’d kill him if
they found him. Do you know what I heard to-night?”</p>

<p>But the girl did not answer. She was putting on her
clothes in the dark.</p>

<p>“Why did you send him—what for?” she asked harshly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“I sent him to a town—he says there is one—to get a
boat and come back and take us away. It’s all we can do.
Egerton isn’t Egerton at all, he only calls himself that,
and he means to carry you off and marry you to Mr. Erle
or leave you here to die.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never go with him. Why did you send Mr. Heriot
away? There’d be time after we’re left here to run away
in a boat.”</p>

<p>“There’d be no time for anything, for Heriot and me.”
But the words did not touch the girl. For the first time
a distrust of Andria seized her.</p>

<p>“You sent him away because he loves me!” she cried.
“I don’t believe Mr. Erle wants to marry me. I’ve believed
everything you say, like a fool, and I don’t even
know why you call yourself Holbeach. For all I know
your name may be Heriot. He knew you when he came
here.”</p>

<p>“My God!” said Andria Erle. No blow of her life had
ever hurt her like this one. She pulled a sealed envelope
from the bosom of her dress and thrust it passionately
into Beryl’s hand.</p>

<p>“Look at that, and you’ll see my name,” she cried, “and
may God forgive you! I swear before Him that Heriot is
not and never was anything to me.”</p>

<p>Something in the utter agony of the voice broke
through the suspicion, the jealousy, of Beryl Corselas’
heart.</p>

<p>“Andria, Andria!” she cried. “Forgive me! I don’t
want to know who you are, I don’t care, except that
you’re my Andria. I’m wild; if Heriot loved me he
wouldn’t have gone, and he may have gone to his death.
I must go out and find the old man and his cats. I’m
frightened what they may do.”</p>

<p>“Not love you—Heriot! He loves you enough not to
care that you’re——” she stopped. She could not tell and
there was no chance now, for the girl was past her like a
whirlwind.</p>

<p>If she had known, she could have found a better way,
and now it might be too late. These very jaguars she
had kissed and stroked might even now be tearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
Heriot’s flesh out on the hillside. With a throat that was
dry with fear for him, she stood in the garden and
quavered out her strange, crooning song. She believed
Andria, and yet, oh! if Heriot would only come back and
swear to her that he loved her!</p>

<p>The moon had set, and in the hushed darkness that
comes before dawn the woods lay silent and terrible.
Trembling and desperate the girl crooned on, and presently
from far away there came a low, wailing cry. It
was so far off that she shook for fear she was too late.
Staring vainly into the darkness in the direction Heriot
must have taken, she almost cried out as a cold hand
touched hers from behind. The old man, bent almost
double, was at her feet, his dreadful pets behind him.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” she cried, agonized loathing
in her voice. “What have you done?”</p>

<p>“Little dearest,” he answered submissively, “you told
me to go and I went. I was asleep; my cats were tired,
for it is nearly dawn.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen any one?” her strong young hand
gripped him fiercely. “Tell me!”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, listen!” Beryl said, tears of relief in her hot eyes,
for the man spoke quite sanely and there was truth in his
voice. “I told you to-night you must not hurt that man
who came to me——”</p>

<p>“We have not touched him, <i>querida mia</i>,” he answered,
cringing under her hard grasp. “Was that why you
called?”</p>

<p>“No,” she sobbed. “Try to understand. I sent him to
the town—there is a town?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he muttered, “a town of cruelty, where animals
are beaten until they die, and men laugh at you if you ask
for bread.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s gone there, to get a boat and come back for
me. You must catch him and bring him back now. Tell
him if he loves me he must come back, but not to the
house. You and he must hide near it, for that man in the
yacht wants to carry me off.”</p>

<p>The dawn had come on them as she spoke, and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
sudden, wan light, she saw his face flush with sudden
fury.</p>

<p>“Do you understand?” she cried sharply. “You must
make him hide, or we shall all be killed. But you must
be ready to fight for me when I call you.”</p>

<p>“Fight!” the crazy old voice rang out with a sound that
made the two great beasts behind him bristle up and lash
their tails. “We will kill! My cats will kill. We would
have fought for you last time, but we were too late. Now
you have come back he shall never get you again.” He
began to leer and jabber at her until, brave as she was,
she feared him. Would a thing so crazy ever distinguish
between Heriot and another?</p>

<p>“If you save me you shall never leave me again,” she
said very slowly, and with that same touch with which
she made the jaguars obey her, she laid her hand on his
wrinkled, repulsive forehead.</p>

<p>“<i>Querida mia!</i>” he stammered, and for the first time he
met her eyes.</p>

<p>“See,” he said painfully, “I understand. This is your
lover in the woods, but you will not leave the old man
for him. And the black-eyed one shall not steal you as he
did before. We, your lover and I, will hide near the
house with the cats. When we are there you will hear
my cats laughing, laughing loud, till the black-eyed one’s
blood turns to water. And when you call us we will come.
We will not let him get you.”</p>

<p>“Not me, nor the woman with red hair.”</p>

<p>“I bit her. I will never bite her again,” he shuffled
with shame. “I will go now.”</p>

<p>“Wait!” she cried. “Can you speak English?”</p>

<p>“English?” he clenched his hands. “No, no English!
It was English took you away.”</p>

<p>“Then take this,” she pulled the beryl ring off her
finger, “and tell him to come back. He must know Spanish
enough for that.”</p>

<p>“At noon we will be back. My cats will sleep there in
the shade,” he pointed to an oleander thicket. “But first
they shall laugh till you hear them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>He turned and ran, bent so low that he might have
been a beast like the sinuous, spotted things that followed
him. Almost before she could draw breath they had all
disappeared in the scrub. Oh, it was an ill-omened messenger
to send! And yet Beryl was certain that to let
Heriot go would mean his coming back to an empty house—or
worse.</p>

<p>“Did you find Heriot?” said Andria, when the girl returned,
pale and soaked with dew.</p>

<p>“I didn’t try.” She turned her face away as she told
what she had done.</p>

<p>“Andria,” she whispered, wan in the first sun rays, “I
wish I knew who I was! For I can’t help thinking I—I
remember that crazy man’s face. I can’t be anything to
him. Oh, tell me I can’t!”</p>

<p>Andria could not answer. For pity could not tell this
girl who played with jaguars that her mother, the madman’s
daughter, had done the same.</p>

<p>“You dreamed it,” she faltered, “you could never have
seen him. You were too little when you came to the convent
to remember anything,” but as she lied she turned
away, sick at heart.</p>

<p>Erle would marry the girl for his own ends. He would
not care one straw for the madness in her blood. But if
she found out, would she ever let Heriot call her wife?
Child as she was, Andria knew that was beyond her.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to take what I gave you?” she said,
pointing to that big envelope on the floor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Beryl deliberately, “but only to remind
myself I was a beast. I won’t open it. I’ll keep it. It’s
none of my business why you call yourself Holbeach.”</p>

<p>Even then Andria could not bring her shame to her
lips. Beryl should never know if she could help it. If
not, she had the envelope; it would save her if Heriot
were not back and Raimond got her. He might swear
till he was black in the face and his own handwriting
would damn him.</p>

<p>“We may just have a scene and be left here,” thought
Andria, “but somehow I don’t think so.” She looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
from her bedroom window with weary eyes and saw
there was no sign of any one coming off the yacht. “I
wish I knew just what they meant to do.”</p>

<p>But it would have comforted her very little if any one
had told her that Brian Heriot had known these two
hours past.</p>

<p>Mr. Egerton stood in his cabin on the <i>Flores</i> making a
hasty toilet.</p>

<p>His thin face was savage as he shaved, and his hand
shook as if from bodily fatigue.</p>

<p>“Why the devil doesn’t Raimond come?” he thought,
and gashed his cheek till he swore aloud, though at the
same instant the door had opened on his son, a disheveled
object in silk pajamas.</p>

<p>“You’d better sit down and wait a moment!” said the
newcomer. “Have a drink?”</p>

<p>Erceldonne mopped his bleeding face.</p>

<p>“Have the goodness not to drawl, I hate it,” he said
angrily. “You can’t be as indifferent as you pretend after
the night’s work!”</p>

<p>“I’m not. I’m much less indifferent,” he said, with a
short laugh. “I begin to have a hankering after that little
devil, now since she’s been sharp enough to deceive you.
I believe if you threw a girl into the sea she’d come up
smiling in some man’s arms!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t the girl. It was that damned governess.
But how the man ever got here——”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t matter now, that I can see,” answered Egerton,
with a shrug. “You’re sure it was the governess?
I thought you said she was old.”</p>

<p>“I said she was an excellent woman,” replied Egerton
dryly.</p>

<p>“All the same. But Mattel said he saw the girl in his
arms. Heriot’s! And the last man in the world to——But
it doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t believe Mattel, like a fool! Or we could——”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t have done any better. I thought it was
all up when I heard you laugh and saw the light go out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
I was in time, though. But, by the Lord, if I’d known it
was Heriot I don’t think I’d have done it!”</p>

<p>“You would have turned out Erceldonne penniless, I
suppose, and let him walk into your shoes! You’re sure
it’s all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I tell you!” said Raimond, with sudden vicious
savagery. “Let it alone!” It was the son who was pale
now, not the father.</p>

<p>“Curse Mattel and his prowling on shore,” he added,
biting his mustache. But the girl he had been willing to
marry for her money—and something else—had suddenly
grown desirable to him since another man had found her
fair. She would be hard to get, too, judging from the
way she had slipped from him to Heriot—and nothing but
the unattainable was ever coveted by Raimond Erle. If
Andria had not been too faithful he might have been at
her feet still.</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for Mattel,” said Erceldonne practically,
“we’d never have known there was a man on the
island. If Heriot kissed the girl he would have married
her.” The past conditional came curiously, but to the listener
it sounded natural enough.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, wash your face!” he said, with womanish
disgust, or perhaps because it was not so long
since he had cleansed a like red stain from his hands.
“And throw away the water. Mattel might think things
if he saw it was bloody. He didn’t follow us, I suppose!”</p>

<p>“Mattel is a Maltese thief, who daren’t think or do anything,”
but he was careful enough to follow his son’s advice.
“No one knows anything but you and me,” and his
hand grew unsteady again as he thought of the awful
danger he had dared last night for the sake of Raimond—Raimond
and Erceldonne.</p>

<p>Beryl Corselas had builded worse than she knew when
she had bidden the madman and his dreadful servants to
keep far away on the night of all nights when they might
have defended her. But all Erceldonne had thought was
that luck was on his side still.</p>

<p>“I suppose there’s no reason to stay on here,” said Erle,
with a glance of loathing out the port-hole. “I’ll do what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
I can with the girl and we’ll take her and the governess
off to-night. I can make love to her, if I must, at sea.”</p>

<p>Erceldonne nodded. He was himself again. No one
would have known him for the man of two hours before.</p>

<p>“The sooner the better,” he returned briefly. “Before
they have time to wonder why he doesn’t come back.”</p>

<p>“Let him alone!” cried Raimond, with that black rage
again. “If you keep harping on him I’ll chuck the whole
thing. I don’t care a damn for the succession, it’s only
the money—and that won’t make me stand your conversation!”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better tell the girl so,” said Erceldonne
dryly. “Do you suppose she is going to avoid the subject?”</p>

<p>“I know it. She thinks we don’t know anything about
him,” replied Raimond grimly. “She won’t dare give
herself away. And once married to her——” he laughed,
and Andria might have known why.</p>

<p>But Andria, for once, was wearied out. It was no
more than eight o’clock and she knew Raimond never
faced existence till eleven. It seemed safe to sleep, and
sleep she must, or she could not think or act. If Salome
came in softly and darkened the room it was without an
idea of the mischief she was doing, nor how Andria Erle
would wake. Beryl, with a strange color in her cheeks,
a strange brightness in her tawny eyes, was freshly
dressed and out even as Andria closed her eyes. From
pure humiliation she had put that thin, sealed packet in
her pocket, but she was not thinking of it now. Up and
down the garden she stepped with a quiet fierceness that
might have been learned from the jaguars she played
with. There was no sign of the crazy old man, let her
call and search as she would; no sign of Heriot, and her
heart grew full of fear.</p>

<p>Yet there seemed little cause for terror.</p>

<p>If she had thought to see Egerton and his son come
hurrying up from the yacht to carry her off she was mistaken.
Neither of them appeared.</p>

<p>She wondered wretchedly why Heriot had left her.
Surely not because they said she had money; it meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
nothing to her, instinct told her little to Heriot. Why did
he not come back?</p>

<p>She was afraid of these two men who had come with
lies. Why should Erceldonne call himself Egerton to a
girl to whom neither name meant anything? It came over
her sharply that an obscure Mr. Egerton might leave
England unobserved in a yacht, while Lord Erceldonne’s
departure would have been chronicled in all the papers.</p>

<p>“Whatever he means to do with me, he’ll do it secretly,”
she thought, trembling. “But oh, if I could only
hear the cats scream! I must just wait. Only wait.”</p>

<p>But though she waited till the sun rose high and the
hours passed at noon, she was waiting still.</p>

<p>And it was so that Raimond Erle came up from the
shore and saw her; standing straight and tall in the blazing
sun among the gorgeous flowers; young, lithe, magnificent
with her dusky hair and her golden eyes, and that
strange color on her cheeks; a woman any man might
covet. And for the first time he cared nothing for the
thing he had done.</p>

<p>Every bit of color went from her face as she saw who
it was, though she had known the step was not Heriot’s.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said defiantly, “what do you want?”</p>

<p>“Only to say good morning. You’re not going to run
away again, are you?” for she had moved restlessly under
his eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to run away. Why should I?” she replied,
with a slow glance of dislike she had not known
the trick of yesterday. “I want to talk. When is—Mr.
Egerton—going to take us away?”</p>

<p>“To-day, if you like. But don’t talk here, it’s too
scorching. Come into the house.” There was nothing
but his own comfort in the suggestion, but his glance said
it was hers.</p>

<p>The girl shaded her eyes and looked once round the
empty garden, the stirless noontide woods. There was
not a soul.</p>

<p>“Come in, then.” She had caught her breath curiously.
She led the way, not into the house itself, but up by an
outside stair to the veranda that opened off Andria’s bedroom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
From it she could see the faintest signal from the
hillside down which Heriot must come, if he came in
time; would be within call of Andria, sleeping like the
dead behind her closed shutters.</p>

<p>Erle looked at her.</p>

<p>She had a crushed hibiscus blossom in her hand that
was not so crimson as her mouth. He would get her by
fair means or foul, if it were only for that and her tawny
eyes.</p>

<p>“So you’re anxious to get away?” he said slowly, but
she hesitated instead of assenting.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I was brought here at all!” she returned
at last, frowning.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“Don’t you? I do. Look at me, don’t you remember
me?”</p>

<p>“Look at me!”—with what different eyes another man
had said those very words!</p>

<p>“Remember you!” she retorted. “No; how could I?”</p>

<p>But she shivered. The man was lying, as Andria had
warned her he would lie.</p>

<p>“Think!” he said. “Have you forgotten one evening at
Blackpool station? And a frightened girl who stood
there without anywhere to go? Because I remember, if
you don’t.”</p>

<p>But like a flash it had come back to her. His white
duck clothes made him look different, but it was the same
face she had seen. And she remembered there had been
no pity in the man’s eyes as he watched her.</p>

<p>“You do remember!” he said. “Well, don’t be angry
if I tell you something. I went away and you haunted
me. I couldn’t forget you. When I heard of the girl
found starving in the wreck I knew it was you. I sent
my father to get you from—the woman”—with a momentary
hesitation, since he had never known exactly
about that part of the business and dared not invent—“who
had adopted you. It was I who suggested bringing
you here,” he continued calmly lying. “I knew convent
arms are long and you weren’t safe in England. But if
you want to go back you can, though it’s a living grave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
a convent, for a beautiful girl,” he spoke dreamily, and so
impersonally that yesterday she would not have noticed
the flattery.</p>

<p>“Why did you care?” abruptly. “I was nothing to
you.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to help you live your life,” he said, with a
queer shrug. “That was all. Oh! you are a child still.
You’ve seen nothing. Not diamonds, nor satin gowns,
nor balls where the music gets into your blood and you
know half the men in the room are mad about you.”</p>

<p>“To that life?” said Beryl slowly, for Brian Heriot had
told her none of these things. Yet she searched the
empty hillside once more with her eyes.</p>

<p>“That, and more. I don’t know why I cared you
should be saved from the convent, but I did. You can go
back, as I said, if you like.”</p>

<p>“No!” she said, with a shudder, remembering only the
cruelty of Mother Felicitas and nothing of the kindness
of the other nuns. “They said I had no name, that I was
a charity child. Am I? If you know anything about me,
tell me!” she could not keep back the question, though she
knew it was useless, but the slow, insolent answer turned
her blood to fire.</p>

<p>“You are Beryl, and you have golden eyes. I don’t
know, or care for anything more.”</p>

<p>“You do know who I am!” she flashed out at him, “else
why would your father trouble with me? If he is your
father and not your uncle, as you said.”</p>

<p>His face changed ever so slightly. Well, Heriot was
paid for talking!</p>

<p>“I know nothing but that I have done my best to help
you from that very first night I saw you,” he said, very
low.</p>

<p>There was a passion on his face there had never been
on Heriot’s, but she was not old enough to know that
passion in a man is the very last reason for a woman to
trust in him. And the sudden softening of the haggard
lines round his mouth, the widening of his eyes, made her
for the first time wonder if, after all, he were speaking
the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“Where do you want to take me?” She was staring at
him with great, fascinated eyes. If he had been like this
yesterday she would never have run away from him, unwarned
as she was then.</p>

<p>“Back to England—to London—to the world. Why
should you be buried here?” he said slowly.</p>

<p>“But you said it wasn’t safe,” she faltered. “The convent——”</p>

<p>“Can’t recall you if you’ll let me take care of you,” he
answered, with his voice utterly caressing. “Will you?”</p>

<p>For the first time she saw what he meant, what he had
been meaning all along. And it was just what Andria
had said. With a start of fright she sprang up.</p>

<p>“Do you mean you want me to marry you?” she cried,
wide-eyed, and, without her will, Heriot’s face sprang to
her memory.</p>

<p>She was so beautiful as she stood aghast and trembling
that the man lost his head.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “just that!” and before she could move
had caught her to him and kissed her madly.</p>

<p>She could not cry out because his lips crushed her
mouth, but the stifled moan would have brought any other
man to his senses. She fought against him till her lips
were free.</p>

<p>“I hate you,” she stormed. “Why did I ever listen to
you when Andria—ah!” she screamed at the top of her
voice. “Andria!”</p>

<p>If she had stabbed him he could not have let her go
more suddenly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he said. “Who is Andria?”</p>

<p>But it was another voice that answered him from behind
his back.</p>

<p>“I!” said Andria Erle, standing like a ghost in her
white dressing-gown between the open green shutters of
her bedroom window.</p>

<p>Raimond Erle turned livid.</p>

<p>It was Andria; Andria who was the governess, who
had been engaged to take care of the only girl in the
world she should never have met!</p>

<p>He saw once more the pale face, the red-brown hair of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
the woman he had called his wife—and the only emotion
it brought him was furious hatred.</p>

<p>He looked from her to Beryl and back again and knew
what he must do.</p>

<p>“And who,” he said calmly, “are you?”</p>

<p>“No one,” she answered steadily, “now! Shall I tell
you who I was?”</p>

<p>Her eyes blazed at him, standing at the window of the
very room where she had thanked God he had come back
to her. The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “stand back! I will tell you what you
were, and are. A woman who is no fit companion for an
innocent girl, who is here under false pretenses and a
feigned name.”</p>

<p>His quick ear had caught footsteps coming up the
stairs, and as Andria caught her breath at the words that
were true enough in their way, Raimond Erle turned to
his father.</p>

<p>“So this is your governess!” he cried, before she could
speak. “Do you know who she is? A woman who was
the talk of all London—a woman no girl should so much
as see!”</p>

<p>“Raimond!” She had been his wife for five years, or
she thought so; small wonder she cried out as if he had
struck her. She reeled where she stood.</p>

<p>“Take the girl away,” said Erle savagely. “Don’t you
understand?”</p>

<p>But at that cry of his son’s name Lord Erceldonne had
understood indeed.</p>

<p>It was this woman and no other who had enslaved Raimond
for five years, and the very irony of fate had
brought her here to ruin him.</p>

<p>“Andria, what does he mean? What does he know
about you?”</p>

<p>Beryl had sprung between the two men and flung her
arms round Andria’s neck. But the woman stood cold as
marble.</p>

<p>“Come!” said Erceldonne, between his teeth. He laid
his hand on Beryl’s shoulder and she tore it away.</p>

<p>“Andria, speak to me, don’t mind them!” she cried. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
believe in you. I don’t care what they say, Andria, darling.”</p>

<p>Erle’s discarded wife caught her in her arms and stood
back, knowing that the time was come.</p>

<p>“I am what you made me!” she cried to the man whom
once she had loved. “I will take care you have no other
girl to torture as you have tortured me. Oh, I know why
you want her, why you changed your minds about letting
her die here!” She came a step nearer to Erle, still holding
Beryl clasped in one arm. “But you forgot me!”</p>

<p>Her breast heaved as if she could not breathe. She
kept her eyes on Raimond’s face and never saw Erceldonne
as he slipped behind her.</p>

<p>There was no stopping the tongue of a furious woman,
but if Beryl heard her story the game was up. And without
the girl, ruin stared him in the face. Dead or alive,
they must have her, and there was no driving Raimond
when he had the bit in his teeth. He would have her
quick, not dead, in spite of all the discarded women in
London.</p>

<p>“Come,” he repeated, with a voice he tried to make
shocked but only made angry. “This is no place for you.
And as for you, madam,” to Andria, “we will leave you
to the society of your friend, Mr. Heriot. I may say that
what I saw last night shocked and pained me inexpressibly.”</p>

<p>He took Beryl by the arm, but she struck back at him
wildly, with all the strength of her young arm. For an
instant the man staggered; the next he had caught his
son’s eye.</p>

<p>“Settle it,” he said, with an ugly word. And with
hands that were strong as steel he forced the two women
apart. It was done so dexterously that neither had time
to make a sound, but the girl turned on him viciously,
wrenched away from him, and fell backward down the
wooden stairs. As she fell she screamed, but another cry
covered it.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward Raimond Erle came quietly out
of a house that seemed strangely still. There was blood
on his hand and he wiped it away with fastidious care.</p>

<p class="center">A MURDER IN THE DARK.</p>


<p>“Salome, I am going to shut up the house and take all
the ladies away! They have gone down to the yacht already.
Pack your things, and be as quick as you can, the
three of you. I don’t want to waste any time in getting
off.”</p>

<p>The servants’ quarters were on the other side of the
house from Andria’s shaded veranda; the three women
had heard nothing as they sat chattering with the doors
shut to keep out the noontide heat. Yet Salome leaped to
her feet with a sudden foreboding, as she saw her master
open the door.</p>

<p>There was a look on his face she had reason to know,
and as he spoke her own grew ashy. Yet to Chloe and
Amelia Jane his matter-of-fact words were joyful tidings
indeed, and scarcely uttered before they were gone to
gather their belongings. But Salome stood just as she
was when she sprang up and saw her master’s face.</p>

<p>“Go!” he said sharply. “I’ve no time to wait for you.”</p>

<p>“Where’m I going?” she asked sullenly. “Where’ve I
got to go?”</p>

<p>“Where you like, but out of this and away from me!
I’ve no further use for a servant who harbors men in my
house in secret.”</p>

<p>So he knew! Salome’s face grew a shade more gray.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” she said. “He went last night.”</p>

<p>“He’s gone, but you’ll go, too!” he answered, with a
meaning not lost on her. “Get your things.”</p>

<p>“Master, master!” her voice came strangled as she
threw herself at his feet. “I can’t go nowhere, you know
dat.”</p>

<p>“It’s no concern of mine. I’ve hidden you long enough
when you betray me. You can come or stay, or drown or
hang, as you like. Thank your stars I don’t send you
back to Jamaica! You fool, who’s to know you in England?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>But she had seen his eyes as she scrambled to her feet.
There would be no England for her. She knew too much
to leave, and too much to tell where he was going. A
dark night, a high wind and a heavy sea, and—even her
miserable life was dear to her!</p>

<p>“Dat’s true, dey’s no one’ll know me in England,” she
said softly; too softly if the man had been his usual acute
self. She turned quietly away and followed the other
women.</p>

<p>Her master’s heart “beat quick and thick, like a madman
on a drum,” as he stood in the scorching courtyard.
No one could get to the big house without crossing the
paved yard, which no one should do. Raimond, with his
white sleeve rolled up till an ugly stain was hidden, had
carried Beryl down to the yacht. Her fall had stunned
her, and she hung heavy like the dead in his arms. What
he had begun in Andria’s room the crazy man and his
jaguars would finish, when the house lay empty and deserted,
with no one to bar the doors.</p>

<p>Erceldonne turned with a sharp word as the three black
servants came out, each with a bundle on her head.</p>

<p>Something had quieted Chloe and Amelia Jane, or else
it was the dreaded presence of their master that lent speed
to their feet as they hurried down the path before him.
Salome had never opened her lips as she gathered up her
clothes. She walked before Egerton with a slowness that
maddened him, for he dared not precede her. The great
door of the house stood open as they passed, and she saw
it. What man in his senses would go away and leave his
house open, for the things that haunted the place to ravage?
Yet she said nothing as they went on in the blazing
sun.</p>

<p>There was not a sound anywhere; not a breeze even,
when they reached the corner of the path and saw the
open bay before them, with the boat waiting at the shore
and Chloe and Amelia Jane already in it in their haste to
be gone. Yet even Chloe and ’Melia Jane leaped to their
feet at the sudden strident howl that waked the noonday
hush. They had heard that cry before; in the night it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
broken their dreams, but in the broad daylight it brought
the terror of death on them.</p>

<p>From far up behind the house it rang, something between
a wail and a scream, but full of a hideous menace,
a ravening fierceness. Before Erceldonne could draw
breath, it seemed as though hell had broken loose behind
him. Sharp, snarling cries ran under that awful, ceaseless
wailing, and each second were louder and louder.</p>

<p>“Run!” cried the man, with white lips, feeling in his
pocket for the revolver that was not there. “Run!”</p>

<p>But Salome, like a black statue, stood in his way.</p>

<p>“Dey smells de white blood,” she said politely. “De
meat fur de jaguars’ wedding.”</p>

<p>With a furious word, Erceldonne sprang past her. He
was brave enough, but not for the terror that runs scenting
its prey in daylight. He tripped and fell headlong
over the bundle she threw in front of him, but before she
could seize him he was up on his feet and running wildly.
In the hideous uproar that came nearer and nearer, Salome
laughed.</p>

<p>“Run, run!” she screamed aloud. “You ain’t going
quick enough; dey got de heels of you!” She bowed and
swayed in horrible derision, as he stumbled, recovered
himself, and tore on. The next instant she had taken to
her heels and was running faster than Erceldonne himself.
But not to the boat. Something yellow and white
had flashed by her, hunting silently, without a sound. By
instinct, she ran, she knew not where; and as she ran she
shrieked.</p>

<p>The Italian captain of the <i>Flores</i> had been a cutthroat
from his youth up, and now made an excellent livelihood
by hiring out his yacht and asking no questions. But
even he was pale as he stood on the bridge and took the
boat away from that accursed island. That there should
be wild animals in so desolate a place seemed natural
enough to a man who knew nothing of the Azores except
the name; yet he had never seen even tigers so fierce as to
hunt men in broad day. And hunt they had. Mr. Egerton
had saved his life by a bare fifty yards, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
screams of the black servants, who had been too fat to
run, rang in the captain’s ears still.</p>

<p>No wonder the signorina had been carried on board
half-dead, or that the two colored women crouched, weeping,
on the deck.</p>

<p>“The place is accursed,” he said sharply to his first officer,
who would have liked to stay and hunt the strange,
fierce beast that had stood snarling at the very water’s
edge and disappeared like magic as he drew his revolver.
“If Mattel had not been a son of the devil he would not
have got off in his skin last night.”</p>

<p>Mr. Raimond Erle drew a long breath of relief as he
sat with his father in the saloon and heard the steady
sound of the screw. He glanced at Erceldonne, seated
opposite him, and aged by ten years by that flight down
the glaring hillside.</p>

<p>“That was a damned lucky escape,” he said slowly. “I
didn’t half-believe in your beasts before. But they’ve
done well by you now!”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>Erceldonne’s breath came unevenly still.</p>

<p>“Do you ever read the papers?” but his own hand
shook as he lifted his whisky and soda, for, for form’s
sake, the two sat at luncheon, waited on by the servants,
who could not understand a word they said. “Well, it
will be an item: ‘Strange and Terrible Story From’—we
can find a place. But it will go like this:</p>

<p>“‘News comes through Reuter’s Agency’—and they
shall get their information in some very natural way that
can’t be challenged—‘news comes through Reuter’s
Agency that the Honorable Brian Heriot, heir-presumptive
to Baron Heriot, and his wife have been killed while
jaguar-hunting in—South America? The late Mr.
Heriot was at one time well known in London society,
and his wife, who perished with him, was a whilom celebrated
beauty, known, for want of another name, as “The
Lovely Andria.” The present Lord Heriot is unmarried
and the title will devolve on the Heriots of Maxwellton.
No particulars of the tragedy have yet been obtained by
our correspondent.’ There, that will explain the sad tale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
we have to tell our charges, and everything will be perfectly
open and aboveboard!”</p>

<p>The whisky had warmed him. He never flinched at the
thought of how Andria Erle must die.</p>

<p>“Have you no sense?” cried Erceldonne angrily.</p>

<p>“We dare not set any rumors going.”</p>

<p>“Public press—nothing to do with us. Some Englishman
is certain to have been killed jaguar-hunting—South
America is a big place, and his name will do for the first
unidentified fool that gets eaten. Put a thing into people’s
heads and they’ll think it.”</p>

<p>“That won’t explain the girl knowing of it!”</p>

<p>Raimond leaned across the table and spoke so low his
father could just hear.</p>

<p>“The girl is my affair,” he said slowly. “You made a
fool of yourself with your island and your governess, and
your fright of an old woman over whom you knew you
had the whip-hand the instant you found the girl. If it
hadn’t been for your crazy friend and his jaguars we
should have been up a tree. When Beryl’s my wife we
can find out who she is—and no reverend mother can get
her away then!”</p>

<p>“How do you propose to make her sign the register?
I’ve no reason to suppose you can make a marriage under
a false name any more legal than the rest of the world!”
said his father cynically.</p>

<p>“That’s my concern,” answered Raimond fiercely.
“You’ve managed this business so far, and you’ve made a
mess of it. If it hadn’t been for you carrying off the girl
like a pirate in a dime novel and getting the only woman
you had reason to fear for her governess, there would
have been no trouble. The girl was coming to me like a
tame bird when that red-haired devil opened the shutters!
As it is, she heard nothing to matter; your ‘excellent
woman’ had evidently kept a close tongue in her head.
But thanks to you, I’ve a hard job instead of an easy one.
I tell you plainly that if she were not as beautiful as
women are made, I’d let her go to the devil—or Mother
Felicitas!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“And her money to the convent and Erceldonne to the
hammer—or you and I kicked out!”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>The brief courage of whisky had died out of him; he
was suddenly cold in the hot, close cabin. To Andria he
gave no thought except that a millstone was gone from
about his neck. But from Brian Heriot, who had been
his friend, he could not get his thoughts.</p>

<p>That blind shot in the dark, that long carrying of a
burden under which he had sweated, though his father
had helped in the task; that sudden light of the match
the latter had struck as they lifted a man’s body for the
last time to cast it down a rocky gully that reeked with a
strange, wild scent—the man who had fired the shot
turned sick as the match burned out, for, in its flickering
light, he had seen the face that would not leave his
memory.</p>

<p>In his amazed and horrified recognition of the man
who had been his friend, he might even then have tried
to save him, but his very start of astonishment sent the
body the faster into that black gully. What happened
next he scarcely knew. It was all a dream of mad panic,
with himself and Erceldonne flying through the night till
dawn came and found them in their boat.</p>

<p>There was no one on watch on the deserted deck, not
even Mattel knew when they returned, careful body-servant
though he was. It had taken all Raimond Erle’s
nerve to put on his night-clothes and lie down on his bed.
He had been acting, acting ever since, except for those
few minutes alone with the woman who had risen as if
from the dead to balk him.</p>

<p>He had feigned nothing there, only given rein to his
fury till, with a last jerk of his wrist, his work was done.
And he was tired of feigning now.</p>

<p>“Listen!” he said, with outspoken brutality, “once for
all. If you so much as name him to me again, I’m done
with you. You can sink or swim, as you like. I will
never have him spoken of in my hearing.”</p>

<p>For answer, a girl’s voice rang out from a shut cabin
near-by, high and shrill as voices are in delirious pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“Brian!” it called. “Brian, where are you? Heriot,
Heriot!”</p>

<p>For a moment the man trembled, and then the very
rage of hell came over him, that it was Beryl who called
on Heriot and not Andria.</p>

<p>So it had been for her sake that Heriot was on the
island! For a moment he grinned like an angry dog;
and then he saw the servants gazing at him in scared
amazement, and forced himself to laugh.</p>

<p>“Let her call,” he said to his father, in the English
they could not understand. “She’s got to call louder yet
to wake the dead!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE DEATH-TRAP.</p>


<p>In the wild panic that had overtaken her, Salome ran
on and on, crashing in bewilderment through the thick
scrub without knowing or caring where she was going.
Fat as she was, she got over the ground with marvelous
speed, till she tripped on a tough vine and fell sprawling.</p>

<p>The jar and shock brought back her senses. At first
she shook where she lay, lest the beast she had seen
might leap on her and tear her life out, not caring if she
were black or white. But as the minutes passed and
nothing stirred anywhere, the stout colored woman scrambled
up, and stood quivering and panting.</p>

<p>She could hear nothing, though she listened with all
her might; those horrible, snarling cries no longer made
the woods ring. Stupefied, she felt her arms and legs, as
if to make sure they were whole, and then slowly and
falteringly began to make her way back to the house with
the instinct of a lost dog.</p>

<p>“Dey got him dat time, sure!” she thought, stumbling
through the hot, dark undergrowth, a ludicrous fat figure
in stained white clothes, crowned with a frizzy mop of
hair that would have humiliated her, could she have
seen it.</p>

<p>“I’ll go back to de big house; if dey ain’t gone I
kin hide, and dey can’t lock me in so I can’t get out
again. And I ain’t got nowhar else to go. Dese woods
ain’t wholesome at night; black meat and white looking
mighty like in de dark!”</p>

<p>But as she came cautiously out on the hillside and
could see the bay, she flung herself down behind some
bushes and crept on all fours into thicker cover.</p>

<p>The yacht was going. She could see it rounding the
point.</p>

<p>“Glory, glory!” said the woman soberly. “Dey’s
gone. I kin go up to de house and get rested, and to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
I’ll tramp through de woods to dat place Mr.
Heriot’s went to. I guess I kin take in washing wid
de best of ’em, and dey ain’t no one going to know me,
neither. ’Cause a man dat’s inside a jaguar ain’t goin’
to talk—and der ain’t no one else!”</p>

<p>She walked on wearily to the great hall door, and
was just closing it behind her when, from the hillside
behind the house, the dreadful cry of a hunting jaguar
brought her heart to her mouth. With frenzied haste
she bolted the heavy door and the lower windows; but
there came no sound of padded feet in the garden, no
soft, heavy tread against window or door. Only that
wailing cry rang out insistently, as if some beast called
to its mate in vain.</p>

<p>Salome, safe in her fortress, had time to listen; and
knew in another instant that it was no beast that called.
The imitation was good enough for Egerton, but not
for Salome, who knew the real thing.</p>

<p>“’Pears like de end o’ de world!” she said to herself;
but, with the end of Egerton, her heart had an
end of fear. “Dat crazy man’s on top dis time, but de
Lawd be praised, I ain’t out on no sea dis day! Oh,
my poor ladies, my poor ladies! But you’re free dis minute
same as me. De master’s dead!”</p>

<p>She said it with a shudder, for the beast that had
passed her with long, noiseless bounds had not gone
so quickly that she had not had time to see the dreadful
teeth in its red, drooping jaw.</p>

<p>From very force of habit, she turned and went round
the house, inspecting each bolted door. She must sleep
in here to-night, for she was too shaken to cross the
courtyard with that snarling whine ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>She was dizzy, too, with her long run in the heat,
and she climbed up-stairs painfully. It would feel safer
to sleep up there, but her trembling legs would scarcely
carry her.</p>

<p>The room at the head of the stairs had been the
governess’, and the exhausted Salome turned into it,
only to sink on her knees with a groan of superstitious
terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>The governess had gone. Then, who was this who
lay like a log on the floor, face down?</p>

<p>“Lawd, Lawd!” moaned Salome, her eyes all whites
in her ashy face. “Missus, missus!”</p>

<p>But the white thing on the floor never moved. Only
the rising afternoon breeze came through the open window
and lifted the long locks of loose, ruddy hair, and
through the silence came that endless, blood-curdling
wail of the madman outside.</p>

<p>Inch by inch the black woman crawled nearer, her
eyes standing out with terror.</p>

<p>If this thing on the floor should leap up and spring
at her, as ghosts and haunts were well known to do!</p>

<p>But it never stirred.</p>

<p>With the last remnant of her waning courage, Salome
stretched out a shaking, black hand, and then recoiled
with a yell of sheer horror. It was no ghost, but the
governess herself; but, whether dead or alive, the servant
could not tell. Her weariness all forgotten, she
lifted the quiet body in her arms, and saw why it had
lain so motionless.</p>

<p>On one temple was a dark bruise, a deep, oozing cut,
such as might be made by the sharp edges of a man’s
signet ring. And a man’s handkerchief had bound the
slack wrists together; a man’s clumsy, hurried hand tied
a thick, wet bath-towel over the unconscious face, and
knotted the cord from the curtain cruelly tight around
the slim, bare feet.</p>

<p>There were scissors on the toilet-table, and it took
Salome no time to cut the double-knotted towel from
Andria’s head and face. But it took minutes before
the almost suffocated lungs did their work again. Salome
was frightened as she dashed water on the swollen,
crimson face.</p>

<p>“Set up, my lamb!” she cried quickly, when the first
struggle for breath was over. “You ain’t hurt. Wait,
ole Salome’ll cut your hands an’ feet loose!”</p>

<p>To her unutterable joy, Andria began to move. Presently,
she lifted her hand to the cut on her head, but
it fell again, limply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“Dat’s right,” said Salome, fanning her, “dat’s just
right. You’s coming round, honey. Lean against Salome!”
She looked down at the face on her knee, and
the torn, white dressing-gown, and poured eau de
cologne with a lavish hand on the bare, white throat.</p>

<p>At the pungent scent of it, Andria’s eyelids flickered.</p>

<p>“Beryl,” she said, “Beryl.”</p>

<p>Salome nearly dropped her.</p>

<p>“Ain’t she here?” she cried, and something in her
voice roused Andria more than all the restoratives in
the world. “Oh, missus! Ain’t she in her room?” for
if they had not taken one, surely they had not taken
the other.</p>

<p>Dizzy and sick, Andria clutched at her.</p>

<p>“They took her,” she said thickly, as if her throat
hurt her. “Salome, where are they? Why do you look
like that?” She raised herself till she could see the
dark face.</p>

<p>“Oh, missus, dey’s gone!” Salome cried wildly.
“Dey’s gone in de steamer, all but him; and he’s et.
De jaguar done got him.”</p>

<p>She pointed out the window. “Hark at dat!” she
whispered. “De ole man’s singing ’cause master’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Gone!” Andria got somehow to her feet, and nearly
fell with the pain in her swimming head. “Quick, when—did
they go?” It hurt intolerably to speak, but the
dizziness was passing.</p>

<p>Salome told her, but to the story of Egerton’s race
with death Andria hardly listened. Raimond had got
Beryl, and would have killed her to do it.</p>

<p>Mad with rage at seeing her, he had struck her down
on the floor; and then, for fear of what she might
come to herself and do, had tied her, hand and foot,
and left her to the jaguars. She was a woman, and
too faithful. There is no sin on earth a man resents
so much.</p>

<p>“Go look through the house!” she cried, holding her
aching head and feeling her hand, wet with her blood
from the cut Raimond’s ring had left. But she knew
the search was useless. And Egerton’s death was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
neither here nor there. He might have been murdered
before his son’s eyes, but Raimond would not let the
girl go on account of it.</p>

<p>“I fought so badly,” she thought, in wild self-reproach.
“I made him furious. And I knew, if he were angry,
he would stop at nothing. Oh, Beryl, Beryl!”</p>

<p>Sick at heart, with the knowledge of what lay before
the girl when Raimond should tire of her—for a legitimate
wife can be neglected as well as another when her
novelty palls—she leaned against Salome, utterly motionless
and despairing.</p>

<p>“If I’d a gun,” said the woman, suddenly and savagely,
“I’d kill dat ole man out dere! Standing yelling
at de house like a meowing cat.”</p>

<p>“Which man?” but, as if new life had sprung in her,
Andria sat erect and listened. The cry that was
enough like a jaguar’s to deceive most people, rose
across the stillness, and the sound of it made the slow
blood come into her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Just so, Beryl had told her, would the old man make
his cats cry when Heriot and he came back. But for
Beryl Corselas they had come too late.</p>

<p>“Salome!” Andria exclaimed, and for the first time
there were tears in her hopeless eyes. “It’s Mr. Heriot,
he’s come back! Come, help me. We must go out, or
he won’t know we’re alone.”</p>

<p>“Go out—and it gettin’ on to sundown! Lie down,
my lamb,” said Salome coaxingly, “and rest your head.”
For the poor soul could only think the blow had taken
her mistress’ wits.</p>

<p>“No, no!” said Andria. Between laughing and crying
she poured out all that Salome did not know, and
saw, even then, that the woman did not believe her.
“You can stay here,” she ended. “I’ll go. You know
the old man won’t hurt us now.”</p>

<p>“Not wid little miss at our backs, p’r’aps,” said Salome
grimly. “How do you know he won’t say we’ve
took and killed her? Where’d we be den?”</p>

<p>But she followed Andria down-stairs, helped her across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
the garden, too stanch to leave her alone, though great
beads of sweat rolled off her forehead in her fright.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot!” Andria called, leaning against Salome’s
terrified bulk. “Mr. Heriot!”</p>

<p>But nothing answered, till, in the sudden silence that
had fallen as those beastly cries ceased, her own voice
echoed back to her from the wooded hillside.</p>

<p>“Heriot, Heriot—Heriot!” it mocked, thin and clear;
and died away.</p>

<p>With a sob that choked her, Andria remembered that
to call the old man she must croon like Beryl had done,
and she could not remember the weird tune, or sing
it if she could.</p>

<p>“Stay here,” she said. “I must go to them.”</p>

<p>But Salome’s heart was white.</p>

<p>“Might as well die as be scared to death,” she answered,
with chattering teeth, and, with her arms round
the swaying figure of her mistress, she walked on—to
death, for all she knew.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot!” Andria called again, as they reached
the outlying fringes of the impenetrable scrub. The
old man’s name—if he had one—she did not know.
But as she thought it, he stood before her, come out
of the bushes as if by magic.</p>

<p>Salome groaned as only a black person can. But
Andria saw the man’s face, and, for the first time, there
was no fleering mockery in it. In the low sunlight he
looked not the madman she had fought with in the
night, but an old, miserable creature, wizened and bowed,
and clothed in rags that were strangely clean. And
yet she recoiled involuntarily against Salome as he ran
to her, bent forward in the old way, so that his lean,
knotted hands almost touched the ground.</p>

<p>To her utter amazement, he fell at her feet and kissed
the hem of her gown. The next minute he stood up
and began to talk very slowly in Spanish. What he
said she could not tell, but she knew it was a string
of questions. She touched her own breast with a quivering
finger, then Salome pointed, as his wild eyes met
hers, with utter despair, to the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>He understood her, for his face grew fierce, and his
cry of mad rage turned her cold. To her ears, he
seemed once more to be jabbering at her, but, to her
wild surprise, Salome answered him. Salome, an ignorant
black woman, a minute ago palsied with fright, had
gone boldly to his side, and was talking swiftly enough
in a strange bastard Spanish.</p>

<p>The old creature hid his face in his hands with a
pitiful, smothered cry as he heard. Then he turned
to Andria with what—if she had known it—were miserable
wails for pardon, wretched gratitude that she had
at least tried to save the girl whom his crazed brain
still took for another.</p>

<p>Salome, the respectful, shook Andria as if she had
been a child.</p>

<p>“Missus, he won’t hurt us! I told him all we knows,
and he say to come to his place in de woods. Mr.
Heriot dere wid him. And he say his cats is tame,
’cept when he makes dem hunt. You hear him call out
when I say master’s dead? He say: ‘De vengeance
o’ God!’ Just dat, over and over. Missus, de black
work dat I knows been here ain’t nothin’ to what’s been
done to dis poor ole man!”</p>

<p>“Why is Mr. Heriot in the woods?” cried Andria.
“Ask him.”</p>

<p>“Because dey shot him; shot him like dey’d shoot a
dog!” she answered bitterly. “Come, missus, come!
We got to get him to de big house before dark.”</p>

<p>Great tears pouring down her black face, she walked
on, not daring to tell that the old man had said Heriot
was dead.</p>

<p>It had seemed a long, rough way last night in the
dark to that rocky gully for the two men who sweated
under their burden, with eyes everywhere for the dangers
they must dare if Heriot’s end were to be sure.
It was a risky thing—for the throwers—to cast an
insensible man down into a jaguar’s den, and they ran
for their lives afterward for what seemed miles—would
have run vainly if chance had not taken the old man
and his beasts to sleep elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>But it was really no distance, even for a woman
swaying with pain and dizziness, by the smooth, narrow
track the old man took. There was no room for
two to walk abreast, and the black woman put her
strong hands under Andria’s arms from behind and
steadied her, for pain made her reel.</p>

<p>In between two high rocks they passed, and then
squeezed through a narrow passage that wound and
burrowed like the dried-up brook it was, between two
high cliffs. Over their heads the blue sky showed like
a narrow ribbon; the dark air of the passage felt like
a cellar, and, with each step they took after the crazy
man, a strange, wild smell grew pungent in their nostrils.</p>

<p>“It’s de cats,” began Salome disgustedly, and then
yelled in Andria’s ear, and nearly threw her down with
her start. Something had touched her skirts, and over
her shoulder she saw at her very heels, what seemed an
endless procession of wild beasts, walking softly in her
footsteps.</p>

<p>“Oh, my soul!” Salome yelled again, and scuffled
wildly to pass Andria. “Dey’s got me.”</p>

<p>The old man turned with a grin.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, woman!” he said, in his guttural Spanish.
“Those are my sisters and brothers and their children.
They will not touch you till I say—kill!” but at the
word the nearest beast gave a whining snarl, and Salome,
with one bound of terror, passed their master,
nearly squeezing him to death, and out of the passage
into a round, open space like a quarry that narrowed
up into the rocky gully, where last night a murderer
had thrown his victim.</p>

<p>But Andria cared nothing for Salome or the jaguars.
Straight opposite the rocky wall of the queer place was
undermined into an overhanging cave, and under it,
rolled in a ragged blanket, was the motionless figure
of a man.</p>

<p>“Heriot!” she sobbed, and ran to him. But he did
not open his eyes, as she knelt beside him, and the
hand she seized in hers was stone-cold in the hot, close
air.</p>

<p class="center">MOTHER FELICITAS.</p>


<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>It was an indescribable sound, and it stopped sweet-faced
Sister De Sales in the serious business of laying
out her neat little account-books.</p>

<p>Mother Felicitas sat in her straight-backed chair in
her own parlor and gripped the table in front of her,
as if only by holding fast to something could she keep
from drifting out on the great sea of death.</p>

<p>She had not been herself since that strange disappearance
of Beryl Corselas. A constant, agonized fear
that ate at her heart had made even her agonized nerves
give way, her step that had been noiseless, heavy and
uncertain, her pale skin like parchment stretched over
bone. And this morning she had heard that which
wrung a cry from her stiff lips, though she was not
alone to bear her terror.</p>

<p>“Dear mother, what is it?” cried Sister De Sales,
flurriedly rising. “You are ill—suffering?”</p>

<p>For the reverend mother’s face was more grayish-white
than the whitewashed plaster of the parlor walls.</p>

<p>Mother Felicitas nodded speechlessly. But for all
that sudden pang at her heart, she moved her hand
jerkily, so that it covered an open letter on the table.</p>

<p>“Water—a faintness!” she managed to say. But
when Sister De Sales got back with water and wine
the reverend mother was lying back in her chair.</p>

<p>The sister was a simple soul, and saw only that the
Mother Superior’s ill turn was over; not—what the
dead Mother Benedicta would have seen—that a certain
pale-blue, gold-embossed note that had been conspicuous
enough among a batch of business-letters had disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>It was the day for going over the week’s accounts,
and Sister De Sales was wont to dread it, in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
possessing a good head for figures, so sharp were the
reverend mother’s sunken eyes and so keen her instant
detection of a penny out in the balance-sheet. But to-day
she would willingly have seen her books all proved
wrong if only the superior could have strength to do it.</p>

<p>“You are not well, dear mother; you would see the
doctor if I sent for him?” she said timidly, looking at
the gray pallor of the hard face.</p>

<p>Mother Felicitas roused herself.</p>

<p>“No, sister, no!” she said, with a sort of panic, and
forced her manner to its old authority. “It is nothing.
I am not so young as I was, and I forget it, perhaps.
But we will leave the accounts till to-morrow. I—I
will rest now.”</p>

<p>She made no demur as the anxious sister placed a
stool under her feet, but at the gentle coaxing to drink
some wine she frowned harshly.</p>

<p>“No, no! Go,” she said, “and let me rest. Those
things, as I said, can wait.”</p>

<p>Sister De Sales withdrew, softly, aghast. Never in
all her convent-life had she known any duty postponed
“till to-morrow.” The reverend mother must be very
ill, indeed. She would see Sister Agnes; between them
they might make Mother Felicitas see reason and a
doctor. The excuse for her sudden faintness was but
the unselfish desire to spare others pain. “Not so young
as I was,” she had said, and Sister De Sales, stout and
forty-five, knew that she was the elder of the two by
a year or more.</p>

<p>Yet behind that closed door it was an old, old
woman who dragged herself to it and shot the bolt.
It had taken all her self-control not to scream at Sister
De Sales to be silent with her foolish talk about a doctor.
She would have no doctor to speak learnedly to
the next in rank of an overworked body and a troubled
mind.</p>

<p>“I won’t have any doctor,” she said to herself, as
she sank on her hard chair again. “I’m not dying—not
yet! I can’t die,” she whispered with a shudder.
“I should see them all standing round my coffin, I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
hear their astonishment. Sister De Sales, who thinks I
am a saint; Father Maurice, the new chaplain, almost
crying because I had withheld my sins from him in the
confessional.” Her face grew strong again as she
thought where they would bury her—in unconsecrated
ground.</p>

<p>She was a clever woman; she knew even in her
wretchedness now that of all the convent not one nun
had a personal ambition but herself. She had felt the
gentle piety round her stifling often enough, though she
had managed never to show it. There had been reasons
for her to leave the world, but even here in seclusion she
had worked and strained for the power she had reached—worked
half for safety, that there might be no one over
her, half to find peace for her miserable mind.</p>

<p>Well, she had had her way! She ruled the convent
as no one before her had ever done. The community
had never been so rich, so respected; the nuns, if they
did not love her, held her in awe for her saintly austerity,
her ceaseless industry—and here was what it had
all come to. Every one of those good and gentle women,
who were saints, indeed, would shrink from the holy
mother raised above them if her secret history were
revealed. Alive, she would be excommunicated; dead,
she writhed in her chair as she thought of the hushed
astonishment, the shocked amazement of the little world
she ruled.</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” she said to herself. “As I have lived
I will die and be buried; no one shall ever know. But
I can’t die yet.”</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand for the wine she had
refused, and drank it eagerly. No woman in the world
had lived a harder, more self-denying life than she.
Was it all to count for nothing now, just for the want
of a little resource, a little more courage?</p>

<p>“No one shall know,” she said again, as the wine
brought some warmth to her slow blood. As she lifted
her eyes they caught the inscription of a picture on
the wall.</p>

<p>“‘Death and the Judgment.’” The words struck her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
like an actual blow, but she never lowered her startled
eyes.</p>

<p>What she had done she had done. She was willing
to bear the brunt of it, but not the shame of humiliation
before the nuns, who revered her in their pure and
gentle hearts.</p>

<p>“‘Death and the Judgment,’” she thought, but she
dared not say it aloud, when, for all she knew, Death
might be at her very elbow, and for the Judgment she
was unprepared.</p>

<p>Yet no idea of a tardy repentance, a confession at
the eleventh hour, entered her fevered mind, as she
drew that terrible letter out of the folds of her habit.
She had fought her own battles; she would fight them
once more, and then die, if she must, in the odor of
sanctity. She thrust away the thought that this strange
horror at her heart was the beginning of repentance.
Almost she felt her own strong self again, as she deliberately
opened and reread the letter that had shaken
her nerve till she cried out.</p>

<p>Yet it was only a civil, well-meaning letter from one
woman to another.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mrs. Fuller presents her compliments to the superioress
of St. Mary’s Convent, and begs to inform her
that she knows nothing of the missing pupil of that
institution who was supposed to be traveling on the
Continent in her care. Mrs. Fuller was both surprised
and horrified to find that unscrupulous persons had
made use of her name to deceive the matron and guardians
of St. Anne’s Workhouse. The unknown woman
who carried off the girl under Mrs. Fuller’s name must
have been fully cognizant of her movements, as she
had certainly spent the winter abroad with an invalid
niece. Mrs. Fuller begged to assure the superioress of
her deep sympathy in her anxiety for the young girl
who was lost, and also to inform her that she had set
a detective to work to trace out the wretches who have
made so wicked and cruel a use of her name. As yet
no clue had been found to their identity.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>A second note was enclosed in another hand, and it
was this that had brought the reverend mother low,
though it was but a rather disconcerted epistle from a
well-known detective to his employer, regretting that
so far he had discovered nothing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I may mention as a curious coincidence,” ran that
paragraph that had wrung a cry from the wretched
woman, “that if the missing girl’s name is really Beryl
Corselas, her discovery is a matter of importance, as it
may throw light on an unexplained case of murder and
abduction which puzzled the whole force years ago, and,
incidentally, may deprive a certain noble family of their
estates. But that, of course, is between you and me.”</p>
</div>

<p>It struck Mother Felicitas that the detective’s letter
was not especially businesslike; but it would have put
fresh terror in her soul had she known why. The man
was under a deep obligation to Mrs. Fuller, had thorough
trust—this time misplaced—in her discretion, and
was ready to turn the world upside down to find out
the person who had dared to take such liberties with
her name. But as it was, Mother Felicitas had read
enough. She thought of that note written to the guardians
in which she had said that it was on her authority
Mrs. Fuller had taken the girl from the workhouse.</p>

<p>“I can explain that if I am obliged to,” she thought
heavily. “My lawyer will bear me out that I sent him
to make inquiries,” but her brain went swiftly as she
wondered if the workhouse authorities had that letter—or
Erceldonne.</p>

<p>If he had it, her foolhardiness alone had put it in
his hands.</p>

<p>“He would not dare to use it,” she thought, and
wiped her upper lip, that was wet. “It must be he who
has the girl; no one else would be bold enough. And
if he has her, he would not keep her. The money that
I meant——” The pain struck her heart again, and
more dizzily than ever she caught at the table for support.
When it passed she could no longer force herself
to think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>Dim visions passed before her eyes of a boy she had
loved; of another, a half-grown lad, whom she had not
known existed till he was brought home from Eton and
coolly introduced to her as Erceldonne’s eldest son; of
a baby girl she had loathed because she was what a
fair-haired boy could never be; of a thing she had done
to make a man stand in terror of her, and for hatred of
a woman who had never wronged her. It had been in
that man’s interest to keep Mother Felicitas quiet—if
he knew her secret—all of it!—or not.</p>

<p>If he knew!</p>

<p>She groaned aloud. He must have found out something
or he would never have burdened himself with
a homeless girl, long ago thought dead and gone. He
must know about the money, and meant it and the girl
to go to his son with the hard, brown eyes, for whose
sake another lad had been turned out on the world to
sink or swim as he liked.</p>

<p>Hand in hand, the miserable woman seemed to see
that brown-eyed boy and that baby girl, though the
years had long since made them man and woman. If
they stood so, indeed, Erceldonne could defy her, could
afford to stand aside in silence and let her old sins
come to light.</p>

<p>Looking back, Mother Felicitas could see with what
a devilish cleverness he had always stood aside, trusting
to chance and the hour to do what he dared not put
his hand to. Only once had she known him to show any
trace of human feeling—when he took that fair-haired
boy, who had no other real name but Guy, from the
third-rate school, where he was a half-starved teacher,
and gave him five hundred pounds to start for himself
in sugar-planting in Jamaica. She knew that was true,
for she had seen the boy’s grateful letters to the man
he only knew as a distant friend of his father. It had
been sent to her, she knew very well by whom, as the
easiest way of telling a professed nun. It began: “My
dear Mr. Egerton,” but Mother Felicitas knew that
Lord Erceldonne’s conscience would not require him
to tell the truth when he did a kindness. That memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
had softened her heart a little to the man she hated;
it was as well for him that she did not know the bloody
fragments of that uncashed check had lain on a sunny
hillside till they blew away, instead of being cashed at
Lord Erceldonne’s bankers.</p>

<p>“I can’t remember that; it wouldn’t save me,” she
thought restlessly. “I must think of myself.”</p>

<p>While there was life in her she would make one
struggle more; once more, perhaps, feel the joy of
power stir in her and bring a hard man to terms.</p>

<p>Some one knocked at the door. To the reverend
mother it sounded like the hand of fate that will not
be denied. It seemed to her racked nerves that it must
be Erceldonne himself who stood outside, ready to cry
her shame aloud. It took all her strength to open the
bolted door, and as it swung back the two nuns who
waited there stood petrified.</p>

<p>The reverend mother towered over them, clutching
the door-handle and glaring at them with the eyes of
a wild beast. At the sight of their startled faces she
broke into a loud, hysterical laugh that nearly made
Sister De Sales, the timid, turn and run.</p>

<p>Holding the door-handle, the superior laughed and
laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I’m better—quite well!” she cried, that strange laughter
ending as abruptly as it began. “But Sister De
Sales is right. I’m not myself. Next week I will go
to the retreat at the convent in Blackpool for a change.”</p>

<p>The waters of terror were up to her very chin, but
she would wade through them as she had always done,
and get back to firm ground.</p>

<p class="center">HOPELESS AND HELPLESS.</p>


<p>“Oh, Salome, he’s—we’re too late!” Andria, a ghostly
figure enough in her torn white dressing-gown, in which
she had lain down to take the sleep which had betrayed
her trust, and with smears of dried blood on her face,
leaned backward where she knelt. “They’ve killed him.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t de first,” answered Salome grimly, for all
her panic of the slinking beasts that stood round their
queer master. She dropped heavily down beside Heriot,
and would have lifted the torn blanket that covered him,
but a quiet word stopped her hand.</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried the old man. “It is not good that
they smell the blood.” He waved his open hand with
a queer circular motion, and the great cats turned and
seemed to pour into the narrow passage in a living
stream of yellow-white fur.</p>

<p>“I have told them to hunt for themselves,” he said
slowly. “They will not come back till dawn.”</p>

<p>“Praise de Lawd for dat!” grunted Salome devoutly.
She could put all her mind on the dead man now, and
she swept off the blanket that covered him only to
recoil in her turn, for so blood-soaked were his clothes
that she could not tell where he had been wounded.
His face was colorless and quiet over the crimson
clothes that had been white; the woman touched him,
peered into his face, and cried out:</p>

<p>“He ain’t dead, nor he ain’t dying,” she asserted. She
undid his bloody shirt. “De ball must o’ glanced up
on de bone. His ribs is broke from some reason—I
dunno what, unless dey flung him down here!” She
turned sharply to the old man who stood silently by.</p>

<p>“Where you find him?” she asked in the bad Spanish
that had been her mother tongue years ago.</p>

<p>“She sent me out to get him, and I looked and
looked. I came back and struck a track, wide like that,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
measuring with his misshapen hands, “and blood on the
bushes. At the top of the gully it stopped, and another
track began, as if men had run—but light—with empty
hands. And my cats whined and jumped down here.
So I found him,” he answered simply. “It was not
deep where he fell like it is here.”</p>

<p>Andria looked at the high cliff over her head and
thanked Heaven the man who did this thing had been
in the hurry that comes of mortal fear.</p>

<p>“You moved him here! How?” she cried, and Salome
repeated her question.</p>

<p>He took a stone and rolled it over and over. But it
was lucky for Andria she understood only the pantomime,
not the words that went with it.</p>

<p>“I put him in the shade. Dead things bring flies in
the sun, and I wanted him for my cats if she said I
could have him. I went back to the house and called
and called to ask her, but she never came.”</p>

<p>“Shut your head!” said Salome furiously, but also,
with prudence, in English. “We got to take him home,”
she went on; “he may die there or he mayn’t, but we
must carry him. No, you ain’t fit; you’d stumble. I’ll
take de head, and dat ole feller can carry de feet. We’ll
lift him in de blanket.”</p>

<p>The old man nodded willingly enough when she explained,
and Andria saw that it was even with alacrity
that he lifted his end of the burden. She had reason
to know his strength, yet she marveled at it in so miserable
a body.</p>

<p>Salome’s stout arms were tense, and her breath came
hard as she moved steadily along; but the wizened man
seemed to feel neither weight nor fatigue.</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully the wretched procession reached
the great white house that stood open in the desolate,
red light of the sinking sun. Salome had seen wounds
before, and it was as coolly as a hospital nurse that
she did her poor best with this one. When she had
done all she could she drew back and looked at Heriot
lying on the wide, drawing-room sofa that must do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
duty for a bed, since it was impossible to carry him
up-stairs.</p>

<p>“Now you can give him de brandy—just a little taste,”
she said. “It wasn’t no good to bring him to just to
wrestle wid me and jar dem bones.”</p>

<p>But even the brandy did not rouse him, since there
was hardly any blood left in him. His eyelids flickered,
and he swallowed; that was all. Yet Salome regarded
him with a satisfied nod. He had begun to breathe better
already. She waddled off to her kitchen to get
something to eat, and sang hymns while she cooked,
talking to herself with ludicrous effect between the
verses.</p>

<p>“Glory, glory in de shining sky!” she sang, and broke
off between tears and laughter. “He meant to leave
dem two fur de jaguars to eat alive, and he meant to
put me in de sea, for I see it in his face. And he’s
dead and gone and et himself! I’m free! I’m free!”
and in the midst of her ecstasy she stopped short at
the thought of the girl who was taken.</p>

<p>“Pray. Miss Ber’l, pray!” she cried loudly, as if the
girl could hear her. “Pray for de grave, for we can’t
help you.”</p>

<p>Outside in the darkness of the drawing-room, Andria
lay in a low chair, too exhausted to think, and felt a
sudden, humble touch on her arm. The old man fell
on his knees beside her and began to pour out a torrent
of whispered Spanish. Half of it she knew to be questions,
but she could not answer them, and, dazed, she
shook her head.</p>

<p>With a hoarse cry of hopeless disappointment, the
poor wretch leaped to his feet, and before she could
call to Salome, was gone through the open door.</p>

<p>Andria sat up and put her hands to her aching head.
It might be months before Heriot was himself again,
and by that time what could they do?</p>

<p>There was a wounded man, herself, a black servant,
and a madman to cope with Raimond Erle, who was
already out of reach. With such poor allies and no
money, how could she hope to reach England in time—or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
ever? With a gesture of sheer despair, she sank
back again and closed her eyes. The very thing that
would keep Raimond and Beryl apart she had never
told the girl. She cursed her cowardice that could not
speak out, that had solved itself by that photograph in
a sealed envelope. She knew she had never opened it
by the very way she had been bewildered, and looked
from one to the other. It was useless now; she would
not even look for the thing, that must be lying in Beryl’s
room somewhere. She never wanted to see it again.
It was too tangible a reminder of her trust that she
had not kept from cowardly reluctance to speak her own
shame.</p>

<p>In the dark, hushed room there sounded the faint
breathing of the wounded man and a low sobbing that
came from the very depths of a woman’s broken, desolate
heart.</p>

<p class="center">AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH.</p>


<p>“It’s no use,” thought Beryl Corselas, “nothing was
ever any use. They’ve got us, body and soul, again.”</p>

<p>She stared at the sea through the open port-hole, as
if it would help her to think.</p>

<p>How long had she lain in this hot, close cabin, hearing
the endless jar of the screw and the wash of stormy
water on the closed port-hole? And where was Andria?</p>

<p>“She opened the shutters and pulled me away, and
he called her things. Oh, I can’t remember! But I’m
on the yacht again. She must be here, too, for unless
I dreamed it, I saw Amelia Jane in the cabin. I must
get up and find her. Surely, surely they would never
leave her behind!”</p>

<p>She sat up, and did not even notice how steady the
ship was, though it was only that which had revived
her. Between a slight concussion of the brain and being
the very worst sailor possible, things had reason
to be hazy to her. But as she looked about for her
shoes and stockings the door opened softly and Amelia
Jane’s face peered in.</p>

<p>“Amelia!” cried Beryl. “Then I wasn’t dreaming.
You were here! Where’s Miss Holbeach? Tell her I
want her.”</p>

<p>The woman’s face changed convulsively.</p>

<p>“You knows,” she said rudely; “what’s the good of
askin’ me?”</p>

<p>“Answer me! Come in and shut the door.”</p>

<p>But it was only the long habit of servitude, and perhaps
something in the yellow eyes, that made the woman
obey her.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you mean. Quick!”</p>

<p>Amelia Jane shrank against the door.</p>

<p>“You knows dat poor, sweet lady won’t come to you
no more,” she said, more civilly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“They left her!” cried Beryl. She cared nothing for
the servant’s changed manner. “Amelia, they didn’t
leave her behind?” She flung out her hands as if to
beg the woman to contradict her.</p>

<p>But Amelia Jane only nodded dumbly. Great tears
began to pour down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“It was dem beasts you called in,” she said. “But
dere’s no more trouble in dis world for Miss Holbeach.
She’s gone clean away from trouble. De golden chariot’s
swung low to fetch her.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean she’s dead?” Beryl’s eyes were dry,
her tones perfectly even, but Amelia Jane made haste
to nod.</p>

<p>“Who killed her?” Beryl said, with a dreadful matter-of-factness,
her voice very low and steady. But Amelia
Jane saw nothing strange in the question.</p>

<p>“Dem beasts,” she sobbed. “Dem beasts Salome said
was haunts. Dey got her and poor old Salome. Dey
chased master to de edge of de sea; he save you first,
but he ain’t save de others. Chloe and you and me’s
here—but——” she dropped her dark hands with a
gesture of despair.</p>

<p>The girl sprang toward her, a dreadful, tragic figure,
in her white nightgown, her wild, dusky hair streaming.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot——” she said, between her teeth, and,
weak as she was, grasped Amelia Jane’s shoulder and
shook her like a reed; “where was Mr. Heriot?”</p>

<p>“Gone, too; dey all gone.” Amelia was curiously,
cringingly civil now. “He never got far dat night he
went away, for dey found him on de hillside. Dat was
how come dey feared de place and started to take us
away.”</p>

<p>Beryl Corselas caught her breath hard, so that
the woman waited for the sharp cry, the torrent of
tears, that yet she did not expect. And when no cry
came she trembled.</p>

<p>“Dress me,” came the sharp order. “Tell Mr. Egerton
I want to see him,” and something in her eyes
made Amelia Jane hurry as she had never hurried
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“You can’t see him here,” she ventured timidly, looking
at the disordered cabin. “Better come on deck;
we’s nearly to de land.”</p>

<p>“Bring him here!” and Amelia Jane fled for her life
at the sudden, dangerous ring in the voice.</p>

<p>But it was not Egerton who presently knocked at
the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Beryl evenly, and did not start as
she saw Raimond Erle—only looked him up and down
with strange eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment he could not think what to say to
her. There was something terrible in her face, something
like a beast waiting to spring in the tense lines
of her body as she stood opposite him.</p>

<p>He stepped across the threshold in silence, and he
did not close the door behind him, but she seemed not
to notice.</p>

<p>“Where is Andria?” she said. “Where is Mr. Heriot?
How is it that you and your father and I are alive when
they are dead?”</p>

<p>Then Amelia Jane had told her, as she was meant
to do! It is easier to amplify bad news than to break
it. He would strike at the hardest part first.</p>

<p>“So you knew he was there!” he said, with a shudder
that was not all put on. “Beryl, don’t look at me
like that,” using her name as if he had used it many
times to himself. “I know what you think—that only
a selfish coward could have got away from that island
and left a woman to be killed. But don’t judge me
yet.”</p>

<p>“Answer me!” she said fiercely. “What happened to
Andria? You were with her last!”</p>

<p>He nodded, but there was no shame on his face. “I
was with her last,” he said slowly, “but—Heriot was
with her first.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” She drew a step nearer to
him; another, and she would fly at his eyes.</p>

<p>“Listen; be patient. I don’t know how to tell you,
but if you will have it——”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>He saw the wild blood in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“It was this,” he answered very low. “That man
Heriot had been in love with her for a long time—may
have been married to her for all I know. Anyhow, he
followed her. I suppose she sent for him. I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>“How could she send, when we were told the place
was Bermuda?” Beryl asked scornfully.</p>

<p>“You were told that for your own safety. There
were others besides Heriot who might have followed
you,” he answered somberly. “Oh, I’m not defending
my father! He made mistakes, but he meant well.” He
dared not lift his eyes to the fierce-light gaze of hers, but
he kept on steadily: “The man knew she was there; it
doesn’t matter how. He hid in our house and crept away
in the night rather than face us.”</p>

<p>The girl deliberately turned her back to him. He
had his eyes on the ground—anywhere but on her—and
did not see her pull a flat thing out of her pocket,
nor notice the rustle of the thin, foreign envelope that
covered the carte de visite.</p>

<p>“Look at that if you would doubt me!” Andria had
said. She would look at it now.</p>

<p>But when she saw and read she was struck dumb.
No wonder Andria had feared to meet him. No wonder
she had been livid with fury when he saw her. No
wonder——</p>

<p>She wheeled and faced him, the photograph hidden
in the folds of her wide silk belt.</p>

<p>“I——” but she stopped the words on her very lips.
Let him tell all his lies, let him think her a fool! No
one could know better than he that Heriot was not
Andria’s lover.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he knew you,” she said, with an insolence
for which he could have struck her, though he did not
know all she meant.</p>

<p>“Yes, he knew me. Knew me,” he answered slowly,
“enough to know I would not have my father’s roof—or
you—dishonored. But his fear drove him to his
death, and hers, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“When my father came to us that morning on the
veranda, it was to say he had found a man dead, torn
to pieces, not ten yards from the house. And that, if
such things could happen, it was no place for two
women. But you were too excited to listen. You were
terrified that you might be taken away from a woman
who had no right even to speak to you. You fell backward
down the steps before you could be told of the
danger, or the strange man who had been killed by
the jaguars.”</p>

<p>“How do you know they were jaguars?”</p>

<p>Not a cry had been wrung from her, though her
soul was sick to think how the madman and the cats
had betrayed her. How Heriot—she dared not think
or she would break down in her icy calm.</p>

<p>“We had excellent reason. You fell—my father told
that woman her lover was dead, and she must come
with us and you. She laughed. She said she would die
with him sooner than live with us. She—I took you
and ran with you to the boat. My father called the
colored servants and went back for the stubborn woman
up-stairs. But she tore away from him and ran—ran
straight to her death. He saw her torn to pieces before
his eyes, as he saw Salome afterward.</p>

<p>“The other two women had gone on. They will tell
you how they sat in the boat and saw him but just
escape with his life. How they heard Salome scream.”
His face was white and damp as he finished, for what
he knew was a thousand times worse than the lying
tale he told.</p>

<p>Beryl looked at him, and the scornful, accusing words
died on her lips. What did a lie more or less matter
when Andria and Heriot were dead?</p>

<p>“Beryl,” said Erle softly, “try not to distrust me!
My father and I are the only friends you have. You
cannot think either he or I would willingly let such
things be. Your—the governess”—he watched her face
now for answering knowledge, for defiance that was
not there—“was nothing to us but a misguided woman.
We would have no motive——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean to do with me?” she said, as if
he had not spoken.</p>

<p>“Take you with us; make your life happy, till you
forget the horrible things you have known. Hate me,”
he exclaimed with sudden passion, casting the memory
of his crimes behind him, “if you like, but let me help
you—keep you—love you——”</p>

<p>Her voice rang in the little cabin.</p>

<p>“You killed her!” she said, and pointed at him.
“You!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A DREAM OF VENGEANCE.</p>


<p>“I never touched a hair of her head,” said the man
who had merely tied her up to suffocate or be eaten.
“Beryl believe me! I knew her long ago, when first
she was Heriot’s—friend.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you.” She was clasping and unclasping
her hands. “Oh,”—she drew her breath and faced
him like the little devil he had once called her—“not
one word you say is the truth. My cats never touched
her. I—they——” but she could not go on.</p>

<p>He had made one mistake—one glaring blunder—that
made everything seem the lie. It was when he
had linked Heriot’s name with Andria’s to a girl who
had his own damnation in her pocket.</p>

<p>“I will never believe you—never! You may kill me,
too, if you like,” she added, with a slow malice that
made him hasten to clinch his lie.</p>

<p>“It’s true. The black woman told you what she saw.
If I don’t tell you all I saw, it’s because I want to
spare you.”</p>

<p>But she was not listening. The tireless jar of the
engines had stopped; the yacht was lying quiet on a
quiet sea.</p>

<p>“We’re at home in England,” said Erle coolly. “What
will you do?”</p>

<p>“Accuse you—give you up,” she thought, and said
nothing. To be silent was the only chance of doing it.
She wished now that she had held her tongue, as she
felt in her sash her only proof that he might have had
a motive, since Andria was his discarded wife. She
must play her game better than this. If he feared
her he would never let her go. “Oh,” she said, with
a pitiful shrinking from the awful task of avenging the
dead, “tell me, swear to me that all you’ve said is true.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
Then I’ll go away with Amelia and Chloe and never
trouble you any more.”</p>

<p>“Look!” said Erle, and pointed out the port-hole.
There in a boat with their bundles were Chloe and
Amelia Jane.</p>

<p>“You can’t; they won’t take you. All they want is
to get safe on shore. Let them go, ungrateful beasts!
Do you know they dared to say you had the evil eye?”</p>

<p>Amelia Jane’s queer manner and terror of her returned
to Beryl’s memory, all of a piece with her hurry
to be gone. He was telling the truth now, and her
face grew white and vacant. The black woman had
deserted her.</p>

<p>She was too stunned to imagine the truth, that they
were being hurried off to join an outbound vessel for
Jamaica; they knew too much to be let stay in England.</p>

<p>Erle was quick to see his advantage.</p>

<p>“Let them go,” he repeated, “I do not want any
servants who say of you what you say of me—that it
was through you death came.”</p>

<p>“Through me!”</p>

<p>“They said—oh, it’s ghastly nonsense! But they said
it was you who could make those jaguars come and
go as you pleased; that it was you who set them on.
You see, I am not the only person who is thought—guilty!”</p>

<p>He did not say how, when Amelia Jane had owned
to seeing Beryl play with jaguar cubs, it had been easy
to put the rest of the wicked thought in her head, nor
who had put it there. But the girl in dumb agony saw
where she stood. She was utterly in his power. He
might ask her where she meant to go, but it was all
pretense. She would never get away from him and
his father.</p>

<p>With a strange quiet she turned from him, but it
was the silence of danger, not of despair.</p>

<p>“You see,” he said, with the soft voice women had
loved, “other people might be as hard to you as you
have been to me, mad as it sounds. Can I never make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
you understand we are your only real friends? If we
turn against you——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “I hear you. Please go, Mr. Erle.
I—I can’t talk any more.”</p>

<p>Was the man utterly callous that he did not care that
his wife was killed, that he could lie about the dead?
As the door closed behind him she stood rigid, in raging,
biting desire for vengeance.</p>

<p>“I made a mistake when I taxed him with it,” she
thought. “But I know it’s true, for I saw him wince.
Oh, my Andria!” the tears coming at last to her burning
eyes. “I should have stayed by her, held her tight,
never let her go. She warned me what he was like.
Why did I ever listen to him? And what am I, that
he wants me—that he means to have me, even over a
grave? Andria—Heriot——” She crushed her hands
against her mouth that she might not cry out the names
she loved.</p>

<p>“You died for me,” she whispered, anguish shaking
her; “because I am what I am; they killed you to get
me. That man was right. It was I who killed you.
Oh, who am I, that they drag me with them? That
they want me? I would give”—she stopped short, her
strange eyes dilated—“I’ll give my life, Andria; I have
no more!” she whispered.</p>

<p>Two hours afterward there came a knock at her
cabin door. To Erle’s astonishment, she opened it quite
readily and stood quietly before him. It had grown
dark, and the electric light in the cabin dawned slowly
and lit up her face that was white as chalk, but absolutely
indifferent.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said, hiding his surprise, “we are going
ashore. Let the stewardess pack your things.”</p>

<p>“I have none—not even a hat.”</p>

<p>“It’s dark and warm; it doesn’t matter. You shall
have all you want as soon as you land.”</p>

<p>He could hardly take his eyes from the strange beauty
of her face. Transcendental, unearthly, she stood in
the pale electric light as one who sees a vision. The
quick thought came to him that she meant to drown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
herself as they landed. But, though he kept at her
elbow for fear, she never even glanced at the dark
water round the ship.</p>

<p>Only as Erceldonne spoke to her did her strange
calm flicker; hatred sprang into her eyes as she turned
silently away.</p>

<p>In the boat, on the pier, at the station, Erle waited
breathlessly for her to break away. But she stood like
a statue, and never asked a question—moved when he
led her without a sign of dissent. If Mother Felicitas
had seen her face she would have been ready for some
outburst, effective as it was unexpected. The two men
merely thought the shock of what she had heard had
cowed her.</p>

<p>All that night as she sat in a railway-carriage, one
thought rang like bells in her head. The man at whose
door two deaths lay should pay for them. And to do
it she must go with him, find out who she was and
why she was desirable. If she tried to run away they
would catch her; if she went back to the convent she
could find out no more than if she were in her
grave. She sat with eyes shut till they thought her
asleep, and planned and replanned her revenge; that
she might not remember Brian Heriot and fall to crying
for the face that she would see no more.</p>

<p>They changed carriages at dawn, where, she did not
know, nor where they were taking her. She looked for
hours at the flying country and could not tell, till, as
the train stopped, great, black letters on a white sign-board
caught her eye. “Blackpool,” she read in the
veiled sunshine of the February morning, and remembered
it was here she had first seen the haggard, listless-eyed
man who had been her evil genius.</p>

<p>“We change here,” said Erle, rising and not noticing
her as he leaned out of the carriage window to glance
at the station, which was fuller than he liked. But he
was reassured by the look of the crowd, who were excursionists.
Neither he nor his father saw her glance
at the lining of the hat they had bought for her when
they landed. “Pearce, Plymouth,” was stamped on it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
They had come all the way across England here; they
must have a reason. Were they taking her back to
the workhouse at St. Anne’s?</p>

<p>She got out as quietly as if she neither knew nor
cared, but half-way across the station she gasped and
stood still.</p>

<p>Opposite her, with her back to her, but unmistakable,
was Mother Felicitas, Sister De Sales at her side!</p>

<p>They stood, as religious women do, with their eyes
cast down; they had not seen her.</p>

<p>“Mother Felicitas!” she said, with a horrible fear,
not for herself, but for the vengeance that would slip
from her if the superior saw and claimed her. An instinct
like an animal told her she would get no credence
of her tale in the convent.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Erceldonne in her ear furiously. “Go
on!”</p>

<p>The girl faltered, almost fell, and at Erle’s wondering
exclamation Mother Felicitas looked up. Her terror
was before her eyes!</p>

<p>For one instant she stood speechless. Before she
could move, Beryl Corselas had been hustled into a
train that was already moving out of the station.</p>

<p>“The reverend mother has overtaxed her strength,”
said Sister De Sales quickly to a porter. “Water,
please, and I will get her to a cab.”</p>

<p>She was short-sighted, and had seen nothing. If she
had, she would merely have marveled that the reverend
mother should lean heavily against her in sudden faintness
at the sight of a runaway schoolgirl.</p>

<p class="center">A LITTLE GOLD.</p>


<p>“I couldn’t help it,” said Andria, “they were too quick
for me. I am slow-witted. I see now it was madness
to have sent you away, and worse to send that dreadful
old man after you. He might have saved us.”</p>

<p>“How long have I been laid up?” Heriot, pretty
white and bloodless, lay propped with pillows on the
sofa; he was stiff, and his wound was painful, but his
mind was clear. “How did I get her ring?” for the
green beryl glowed on his finger.</p>

<p>“Not a week,” replied Andria wretchedly, for by now
the yacht must have reached England. “I told you
every two or three times, but it didn’t seem to reach
you.”</p>

<p>“It all seemed a part of the pain, I thought—‘beryls
bring bad dreams,’” he quoted. “I wish this was one.”</p>

<p>“The old man must have put the ring on your finger.
Oh, if he would only go away and not sit outside and
moan!”</p>

<p>“Why? What is it to him?”</p>

<p>Even then she could not tell him. She turned away.
“Call the man,” said Heriot sharply.</p>

<p>Andria never looked up as the forlorn wretch shambled
in and stared at Heriot with lack-luster eyes. What
would he tell? or, rather, what would Salome make of
it in her translation?</p>

<p>“She is gone,” he said slowly in Spanish. “This
time it is forever.”</p>

<p>Andria started.</p>

<p>Heriot understood—was answering him in as good
Spanish as his own. Salome stood goggle-eyed, straining
every nerve to comprehend. Only to Andria was it
an incomprehensible medley of sounds.</p>

<p>“What does he say, Salome? Tell me,” she ordered
frantically; but Salome only waved her aside and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
groaned aloud. It seemed hours as the words she could
not understand went on.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie, Mr. Heriot!” broke out Salome fiercely.
“She ain’t look like him; she ain’t be like him——”
But the words died on her tongue remembered how
the girl had mastered the jaguar as it ravened at the
bars.</p>

<p>So the secret was out!</p>

<p>“Salome, hush—wait!” cried Andria frantically. “Mr.
Heriot, stop him; tell me what he says.”</p>

<p>“He wanders,” said Heriot; his bloodless face was
ghastly. “He’s mad; he’s—my God, he says she’s his
daughter!”</p>

<p>“Then it was true.” Andria covered her face. “I
knew; Egerton told me—let it slip,” she whispered.
“But it is her mother who must have been his child,
not she.”</p>

<p>She thought of the strange moods of the girl, her
miraculous power over animals, of the strain that must
be hereditary in her young blood.</p>

<p>“This is the story,” said Heriot. His face was set.
“Erceldonne and another man came here in a yacht.
The second man never came up to the house, apparently;
certainly never had anything to do with the girl.”
(Oh, the pity of that first girl’s silence about the man
who truly never came to the house, but who met her
in secret, unknown!) “And Erceldonne came every
day, and the girl would have nothing to say to him—hated
him. One day the old man heard her scream—not
once—many times. He ran down to the shore,
and was just in time to see Erceldonne put her into
a boat and shove off with her. He had no boat himself,
and I think he must have had a fit there in the
sun. For all he knows after that is that he lost all his
money in Brazilian bonds; he couldn’t follow her. The
servants apparently all left him; he used to sit all day
on the shore with his jaguars—and one day Erceldonne
came back.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Andria breathlessly, for Heriot paused.</p>

<p>“He said he never took the girl; that she left the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
yacht that same night with the other man—all lies, of
course. He landed with men and guns, shot the jaguars—though
two of them got off into the woods without
his knowledge—and, of all things—offered to buy the
house from the miserable father; wanted him to take
the money and go and look for the girl.”</p>

<p>“De ole man crazy,” Salome burst in, “but cunning—oh,
cunning! He says yes, he sell de place. He
creep away into de woods to find his jaguars dat was
left, and he sit and sit again to watch. One day he
catch master, sure!”</p>

<p>Heriot nodded.</p>

<p>“Erceldonne gave him money—something adequate—but
the poor soul threw it in that pool. ‘Gold,’ he said,
‘a little gold to pay for much flesh and blood,’ so he
threw it away. But he got no chance at Erceldonne,
for he went off again the next day. God knows why
he wanted the place!”</p>

<p>“He wanted the crazy man to go on the track of
the girl and her lover,” Andria cried. “The other man
must——”</p>

<p>“Beryl,” said Heriot slowly, “is in some way the
living image of Lord Erceldonne. No! Don’t say it;
let me finish,” for he knew what was on her tongue.</p>

<p>“There were years after that when no one came to
the island. Then one day Erceldonne came back, opened
the house and put in it Salome and a lad of twenty and
went away. The jaguars tore the boy to bits.”</p>

<p>Salome threw up her arms.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” she cried. “It’s true! I set here and
hear dem in de broad day. After dat he brung Chloe
and Amelia Jane, and why, I never knew. He brung
me because—oh, missus, I had a child! I killed it in
Jamaica because it had de master’s eyes. He bring me
here and leave me because—oh!” wildly, “I couldn’t
help myself. I was young den, and he took me for to
keep house. I was mad wid de shame, wid de eyes ob
de white child.” She cowered at Andria’s feet as she
stood aghast. Was there no end to this man’s crimes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>The next moment she put her hand on the black
woman. Who was Andria Erle, to judge her?</p>

<p>“Poor Salome! Poor soul!” she whispered.</p>

<p>“He brung me,” sobbed the woman. “He didn’t care
whether I live or die. He say dey hang me if ever I
dare leave dis place.”</p>

<p>Heriot said something under his breath. Jamaica
had been his first abode when he left England; he remembered
a queer story he had heard there about a
woman named Salome who wanted to murder her child
because it was white. She and her lover had fled, leaving
the dead child where it lay, and afterward——</p>

<p>“Listen, Salome,” he said quickly, “the child was
asleep, had slept all day. You were frightened and
shook it——”</p>

<p>“I shook de life out of it; it died,” she said, with a
hoarse groan. “It died.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t die,” returned Heriot, with a queer laugh.
“A woman found it and ran with it to the doctor. It
had been put to sleep with morphia; it’s alive now!
And so is the chemist that sold the morphia to a white
man. Your master had excellent reason on his own
account to retire from Jamaica!</p>

<p>“I saw your boy running round selling papers in Kingston,
and some man told me his history. Your shaking
couldn’t have killed a boy like that, Salome, even when
he was a baby.”</p>

<p>She could only stare at him. Then she broke out into
incoherent words—into dreadful laughter.</p>

<p>“My soul’s clean!” she screeched, “clean! I’m free;
I’m free!” laughing still. She rushed out of the house
and leaped and danced in the blazing sun.</p>

<p>“Let her be,” said Heriot softly. “The man was an
iniquitous devil, but he’s paid for it.”</p>

<p>“But Beryl——” Andria’s lips were white. Had the
story of Beryl’s mother put her out of Heriot’s heart?</p>

<p>“I can’t travel for another week,” said Heriot simply,
and a shame came over her at the matter-of-fact words.
“Then we’ll take her away from Erle somehow.”</p>

<p>“But—if he’s married her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“He can’t. Don’t you see, she must be Erceldonne’s
daughter?”</p>

<p>“He can’t be—his son! That must be what they whispered,”
she was whispering herself. “Don’t you see that
solves the whole thing? Her money will set them on
their feet—oh! the money must be a lie to get Raimond
to marry her. She can’t have any money—and neither
have we. How are we to get to England?”</p>

<p>“That’s the easiest part,” Heriot added something to
the old man who stood looking from one to the other,
with eyes that were frightened but sane enough.</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet at the word and ran out after
Salome.</p>

<p>“It’s the succession,” Andria cried, harking back to
her own thoughts. “Raimond will be all right if he
marries her.”</p>

<p>Heriot moved gingerly on his pillows; his face was
pale, but his eyes were shining.</p>

<p>“I’m going to marry her myself,” he said quietly. “I
don’t care if the devil’s her grandfather.”</p>

<p>The old man came running in and poured a stream of
wet, green coins on Heriot’s bed.</p>

<p>They were Erceldonne’s own sovereigns!</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE BEGINNING OF THE JUDGMENT.</p>


<p>Mother Felicitas grew strangely worse at Blackpool.
She only stayed for a week in the quiet convent, and
neither rested nor slept till she was back in her own
place.</p>

<p>But if she had thought to find there a letter from the
man she dreaded she was mistaken. Three weeks went
by, and instead of being reassured by his silence she was
more terrified as each day passed without a letter.</p>

<p>She had known him well enough at the station. Sixteen
years and more had not changed a line in his face.
If his son married the girl, her history would have to
come out—if she were to be a profitable bride. And
Erceldonne could tell it with such iniquitous cleverness
that it would not be he who should be involved in crime
or shame.</p>

<p>Mother Felicitas would have liked to send out messengers
to ransack all England for Beryl Corselas—she had
learned easily enough that they had not taken her to
Erceldonne—since, with the girl in her hands, she could
once more have dictated terms to the man who had been
too clever for her. But she had no one to send; would
not have dared if she had had the cleverest detective in
England to let him try to get the girl and fail.</p>

<p>And if Erceldonne did not write, the real Mrs. Fuller
did: She assured the reverend mother, with great gusto,
that every effort was being made to find the missing girl.</p>

<p>“It is no business of a stranger’s—an outsider’s!”
Mother Felicitas said, with stony calm that covered fury.
“Why does this Fuller woman make it hers?”</p>

<p>But even while she asked the question of the bare
walls of her own convent parlors she knew the answer.</p>

<p>Years ago there had been a hue and cry over the sudden
death of a woman and the disappearance of her
child. It was Mrs. Fuller’s friend the detective that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
was so hot upon the trail. To solve a mystery that thirteen
years ago had been given up by the whole force
would make his reputation.</p>

<p>The woman who said to herself that she never repented
was perilously near to repentance now. The dread
of shame and disgrace distorted her face where she sat
alone.</p>

<p>“He means that son to marry her—for the Corselas
millions that are crying for their owners, for the succession
that can be assured in no other way. And the announcement
of that marriage under her own name or her
mother’s will spring the mine under me! And I can’t
stir a finger. It’s a month since I saw them with her;
it may be too late now. Every one in England but me
may know the missing girl is found.”</p>

<p>She could not keep her hands still nor her mouth
steady. Retribution was coming to her—punishment for
those long years when her whole life had been a blasphemous
lie. She had no hope that Erceldonne would
hold his tongue when the announcement of his son’s
marriage brought a stern order for an explanation from
the law of the land; from chancery, too, that had the
Corselas money in trust. There was one point where
nothing but the truth would clear Erceldonne himself,
and there was no hope that he would not tell it.</p>

<p>“If I could stop the marriage!” almost she said it
aloud.</p>

<p>But she could think of no way that a dying woman
in a convent could balk the will of Erceldonne.</p>

<p>A sharp clang of the old bell that was just outside the
parlor door made her start. It was Tuesday—visiting-day.
She drew herself together to clap her hands for a
lay sister and say that Sister De Sales must see the
anxious mothers of pupils—that she herself was too
weary.</p>

<p>The portress was a new one and not used to her work.
Before the reverend mother had more than lifted her
shaking hands a knock came to her door—a stereotyped
convent knock such as pupils gave—not a visitor’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“Come in!” cried Mother Felicitas, and straightened
up in her chair.</p>

<p>She was nearly ruined, and her power would soon be
a byword; but at least she could still crush a pupil who
dared to come unsummoned to her private room.</p>

<p>But it was no girl with a grievance who opened the
door. On the threshold there stood a tall and beautiful
woman whose eyes were less gentle than her mouth, and
whose red-brown hair——</p>

<p>“Andria Heathcote!” said Mother Felicitas, who never
forgot a face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the visitor, and involuntarily curtsied, as
she had never dared to enter that room without doing.
Yet the next instant she had coolly turned and shut the
door behind her.</p>

<p>Old pupils often came back to visit the convent; there
was no reason for the return of this one to be more than
ordinary, yet the Mother Superior seemed to lack strength
to hold out her hand. Andria, after the first glance,
could hardly look at her. She had been handsome once
in a hard, ascetic way; now her face was but skin drawn
over bone, and her sunken eyes like fires long burned
out.</p>

<p>“You are surprised to see me, reverend mother?” she
began gently. She had never liked Mother Felicitas, but
that might have been her own fault, and the superior was
her one hope now.</p>

<p>“I am not well. I see few visitors,” was the slow answer.
“As you see, there have been many changes even
here since your day.”</p>

<p>“Poor Mother Benedicta!” said Andria, and could not
go on. She had no right to stand in this quiet convent
parlor and play the hypocrite to a woman who might be
hard and cold, but was, nevertheless, a saint in her way.</p>

<p>“Happy, happy Mother Benedicta,” her successor was
thinking passionately. “Free among the dead!” But she
only said slowly.</p>

<p>“Surprised? No; many girls come back. They think
of us sometimes. I suppose you have married, Andria!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
with perfunctory interest, wishing the inopportune visitor
would go.</p>

<p>“Married!” said Andria, who once had thought she
was Andria Erle. “No!”</p>

<p>The words were almost a cry, and for the first time the
Mother Superior looked at her.</p>

<p>“Mother Felicitas,” she began, forcing herself to speak
out under those unfriendly eyes. “I have no right to be
here, no right to force myself on any one like you—but
one. I am in great trouble. I have been a wicked
woman, but—I am in great trouble.”</p>

<p>“And you want to come back!” came the answer
slowly. Trouble was the only thing that ever brought
them back—to stay!</p>

<p>“No,” said Andria, looking round her with a shudder;
she would eat her heart out here. “No! Mother Felicitas,
I told you I had been wicked—a fool——”</p>

<p>“They are the same,” said Mother Felicitas shortly.</p>

<p>“But I woke up from my dream. I tried to do faithfully
the work that was put into my hands, and—I
failed! I have no one to turn to; I am in despair, yet,
perhaps, there is time to save my trust yet, if you will
help me. No one else can.” She held her hands clasped
tight before her, and spoke in a whisper. “Oh! reverend
mother, who was Beryl Corselas?”</p>

<p>The quiet room heaved like a sea before her hearer’s
eyes. The black letters under the picture she dreaded
seemed to spring into life, to speak aloud:</p>

<p>“Death and the Judgment!”</p>

<p>Well, Death was coming, and here, against all canons,
was the beginning of the Judgment before it! Yet the
superior managed to answer:</p>

<p>“Is that your trouble?” she said. “It is a very old one,
and I know no more about it than you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother Felicitas, think! Try to remember,”
with sudden gentleness that was more dangerous than
the other woman’s passion. “You knew once. Long,
long ago you told Beryl her mad temper came to her
honestly—that her mother was the same.”</p>

<p>“I!” The superior was, for an instant, staggered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
“If I did I was much to blame,” she went on lamely
enough. “We thought at one time we had a clue to her
parentage, but it proved a wrong one. When she ran
away from us we knew it.”</p>

<p>“Mother, listen!” said Andria, more gently still.
“You don’t know what hangs on it. Even now that
poor child may be trapped into a marriage she hates—may
be——”</p>

<p>“You know where she is?”</p>

<p>“If I did I would not come to you.” That quick cry
had made her old distrust wake armed. “But I know
who has her. When you know, you may perhaps remember—something—that
may help me to find her.</p>

<p>“I have been a governess since December, and Beryl
Corselas was my pupil.”</p>

<p>Mother Felicitas leaned back and gripped the table in
the old way. She could not speak.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“A BOY!”</p>


<p>“Last autumn,” Andria looked straight at the rigid
figure in the chair, “I was in London, deserted, nearly
starving. A man who called himself Egerton engaged
me, without a character, to travel with his ward. And
the ward was Beryl.</p>

<p>“He said we were to go to Bermuda, but he took us
to a place the merest child would have known was not
that. A lonely island with one house, in miles of scrub”—there
was no change on the superior’s face; could she
have heard of that island before?—“a house that was
locked every night like a fortress for fear of a crazy man
and of wild beasts that hunted to the very door. He left
us there to die, with no one but three black women to
protect us. To die, reverend mother, as a boy died whom
he took there five years before.”</p>

<p>Death—Death and the Judgment! Mother Felicitas’
face bore no longer the look of a human countenance.</p>

<p>“Five years,” she said. “A boy?”</p>

<p>“He seemed a boy, Salome said, because he was so
young in his ways, had such merry gray eyes and was so
gay; but he was twenty. And the jaguars tore him to
bits, as they were meant to tear us.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” and if there can be such a thing as a
whispered shriek it came from the tortured lips of the
Mother Superior.</p>

<p>“I frighten you? It’s too horrible to hear? It was
more horrible——”</p>

<p>“The boy!” Mother Felicitas clutched Andria’s arm
as she had been clutching the table. “The—the poor
boy! You said he was called——”</p>

<p>She had said nothing, but she did not remember.</p>

<p>“Guy, Salome called him, but I never heard his other
name.”</p>

<p>“Guy.” All hell had opened under Mother Felicitas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
but not the hell she had feared. Pain a thousand times
worse than the disgrace she had dreaded made her groan
aloud, and then a very recklessness of fury shook her, as
it might a mother whose only son has been murdered.</p>

<p>“Go on,” she said, and drew her breath through her
teeth. “Er-Egerton took him there—and he died.”</p>

<p>“He was killed! Then we came and Beryl could master
the jaguars, could master the madman afterward;
they never touched us. But we were left for worse than
jaguars. Egerton came back, and his son, Raimond Erle.
Egerton—I say—but I mean Lord Erceldonne—and they
plotted to take Beryl away and marry her to Erle for
her money and something else. Think, Mother Felicitas!
Can’t you remember anything? Who was the girl that
they wanted a waif like her?”</p>

<p>“I—I never knew!” and then in her terror strength
came back to her. “I tell you,” she cried fiercely, “I
know nothing. How could I know, who have been dead
to the world these thirteen years?”</p>

<p>“The year Beryl Corselas was brought here.”</p>

<p>It was said musingly, and yet it carried meaning.</p>

<p>The reverend mother could grow no paler, but her
eyes were like living coals now instead of dead ones.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” she said. For the moment Beryl Corselas
was nothing to her. She could only think of the
boy who had been taken to the uttermost parts of the
earth to be got rid of, from mere wanton weariness of
his face.</p>

<p>“No, they took—at least Raimond Erle took—Beryl
away and left me tied up with cords, towels, anything,
that I might die like the boy. Lord Erceldonne—oh!”
she cried, “Mother Felicitas, Lord Erceldonne is dead.
The jaguars killed him as he meant them to kill us, before
something made him change his plans and want
Beryl to go with him and marry his son.”</p>

<p>“Dead! When? Speak, Andria.” But if for an instant
a fierce hope glowed in her, the next it died.</p>

<p>“Five weeks ago, on the island.”</p>

<p>The Mother Superior dragged herself to her feet.</p>

<p>“Go!” she said, and her voice was strong and resonant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
“Go. You said well that you were a wicked woman,
when you dare to come here with lies.”</p>

<p>It was a trap. By a very hair she had escaped it.
Erceldonne himself must have sent this woman here.</p>

<p>But Andria never stirred. She had been right about
what the superior knew—for Mother Felicitas was
afraid!</p>

<p>“I’ve not finished,” she said as she looked straight into
those awful eyes that seemed to see things that had
shriveled them to look on. “That madman said Erceldonne
had taken away his daughter years ago, that Beryl
was this same daughter come back again. He said——”</p>

<p>“What is it to me?” cried Mother Felicitas. “I know
none of them. Why do you come to me?”</p>

<p>For a moment a spirit as harsh as her own looked out
of Andria Heathcote’s eyes.</p>

<p>“You do know,” she retorted, “and you will know
more unless you help me to stop this marriage and save
Beryl Corselas. Do you think if Erceldonne had sent me
I should have let out that story about the boy who was
killed on the island that you—know of? And he could
not send me, for he’s dead!”</p>

<p>She turned to go, but a hand colder than death fell on
hers.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Mother Felicitas, “wait!”</p>

<p>She tottered to her chair, and signed to Andria Heathcote
to lock the door.</p>

<p>She was speaking the truth according to her lights,
and the reverend mother knew it.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE DARK HOUSE.</p>


<p>That Beryl Corselas was not at Erceldonne Mother
Felicitas knew. But that he owned a disused, rat-haunted
house in Westmoreland even the superior had
almost forgotten.</p>

<p>And it had been a very simple business to double on
their own track at Blackpool and get off at a desolate
little station in Westmoreland.</p>

<p>It was pouring rain. Beryl, hurried into a close carriage,
had not time to see the whilom convent “boy of all
work” was the driver. They drove on endlessly it
seemed to the girl. Through the rain she could see nothing
but endless, rolling moors. When at last they
stopped it was pitch-dark. Dazed and weary Beryl got
out and for the first time trembled.</p>

<p>A dark house, without a lighted window, stood before
them. Erceldonne was unlocking the door with a key
from his pocket, and as he swung back the door a close,
cold air of emptiness and desolation came out on the girl.
What were they going to do with her? How could she
avenge Andria here?</p>

<p>She fought down the cowardly thought that at least
she would have been safe in the convent, and followed
Erle into the dark hall. The cold air of it breathed like
death and the grave.</p>

<p>He struck a match and opened the first door he came
to.</p>

<p>“Why is it like this?” he said to his father angrily.
“Do you want us to die of cold and discomfort? Where
is the woman?” But before there was time for an answer
a door opened, and against a blaze of light that
made her blink Beryl saw the woman who had taken her
from the workhouse.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Fuller!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned the woman slowly, “Mrs. Fuller.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>She was not given to pity, but for one weak instant
compassion rose in her. The next she swept it away.
There was no need to pity the girl. Erle meant to marry
her. She drew back as Beryl ran to her.</p>

<p>“Your dinner is ready,” she said to Erceldonne.
“Such as it is.”</p>

<p>Tone and manner were so changed from the Mrs.
Fuller she had known that Beryl stood astounded. Then
it came to her with an awful sinking of her heart that
this woman was in the plot against her, was a part of the
mystery she loathed and feared. There would be no help
from her.</p>

<p>She looked around the room into which Erle led her
gently. There was a huge fire, a mean lamp, a table
with meat, bread, and wine. Everything else was bare
and desolate. She was suddenly conscious that this was
her prison, where she might live and die unless she did
what they told her. All her fine dreams had come to
this. For she knew by the tinned food on the table that
the pale woman with golden hair had put it there, and
that there was not another soul in the house.</p>

<p>She sat down and could not eat—only looked up with
a start to see Erle and Mrs. Fuller finish and leave the
room. She was alone with the man who called himself
Egerton.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he said coldly, stretching his feet out and
lighting a cigarette. “My son tells me you say he killed
your governess and the man you and she saw fit to hide
in my house. You had better disabuse your mind of
that; and to help you I will tell you who you are—the
granddaughter of that crazy old man on the island. You
may break away from here and tell all you imagine, and
if you do I will prove you as mad as he.”</p>

<p>He waited for an answer, but she only cowered as if
he had struck her. Somehow it was no surprise. All
her life she had been told there was something about her
that was inhuman, horrible. She knew what it was now—remembered
with horror how she had soothed the
madman’s cats with a song she must have inherited the
trick of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“You see,” he said, “you can do nothing. Your
friends, as you chose to think them, are dead.”</p>

<p>“I can go back to the convent,” she muttered, for at
least she could hide her head there.</p>

<p>“You can go nowhere,” he answered coldly. “We did
our best to take care of you, and you repay us with ingratitude.
If I were wise I would put you in an asylum
at once before you had a chance to spread your crazy
imaginings. But I will give you a chance. See,” he went
on slowly, “if with solitude and quiet you will perhaps
come to your right mind. My son——”</p>

<p>“Why did you say he was your nephew?”</p>

<p>This man could only kill her, and at least she would
strike back at him first.</p>

<p>“Did I?” he returned coolly. “If you think, you will
find it was Salome who told you that.”</p>

<p>The memory of that morning flashed back on her. It
had not been Salome who introduced “My nephew, Mr.
Erle.”</p>

<p>“You see,” he pursued, with a shrug, “you cannot remember
anything correctly.”</p>

<p>“I remember this much,” and a tide of fury swept over
her, taking all her terror away. She sprang up and faced
him, with the resemblance to him more marked than
ever. “You knew that island wasn’t safe, but something
made you change your mind about letting me die there.
The evening you went back to the yacht because you
were afraid to stay after what happened to Andria, she
followed you. She heard every word you said to your
nephew where you stood behind the cypress thicket—and
Heriot heard, too. You have done nothing but lie to
me. Even your name isn’t true!”</p>

<p>She shook with passion where she stood over him and
for once he lost his self-control.</p>

<p>“This knowledge didn’t last long,” he said brutally,
for he was not afraid of the dead, “nor will yours, if you
make me angry. Your governess was a treacherous, infamous
woman, who made use of my house to send for
her lover.”</p>

<p>“She never sent. He was wrecked there,” she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
hardly speak for rage. “Oh, you did well to kill him!
In another day he would have saved us both.”</p>

<p>Erceldonne’s face was livid.</p>

<p>“I have had enough heroics,” he said. “No one has
murdered any one, as you are crazy enough to think, and
if you were in your right mind no one would be kinder
to you than I. As it is, all I mean to do with you is to
keep you here till you come back to your senses. You’ll
never get away while you rave like this. I told
you who your mother was—that lunatic’s daughter, but
I did not tell you who your father was. You little fool,
I am your only relation, your only legal guardian!”</p>

<p>“No, no!” she cried, and covered her eyes with her
hands that at least she might not see his face when he
said he was her father. Yet if he did it would make
Erle her brother, unless he were really his nephew!</p>

<p>“You’re quite wrong,” said Erceldonne, with his jarring
laugh, as he saw that at last he had made her
flinch. “It was not I who had the doubtful felicity of
being your parent.”</p>

<p>“Then I am——” she faltered; she did not believe his
denial of her. What could she be, who had madness and
wickedness for father and mother?</p>

<p>“You’re no one,” he answered shortly, “while you
cling to your crazy delusions. If you give them up you’ll
get away from me and be Raimond’s wife. But he
doesn’t want a crazy one, and you can think that over at
your leisure.”</p>

<p>An older woman would have realized that whoever she
was, she must be worth having for them to care nothing
for her strain of lunacy; or else that there was a lie
somewhere. Beryl was ignorant of the world.</p>

<p>The old vacancy came into her eyes as she stared at
the dying coals on the hearth. This house was her
prison; she would never get away from it except as the
wife of a man who, instinct told her, was a murderer.
And she had let them take her past Mother Felicitas,
trusting in her own strength to bring home crime to men
like these.</p>

<p>In all the world there was no one to help her; those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
two she had loved were dead. This was a house the
world thought empty. No one would come here, or
hear her if she screamed her life out. She did not even
know where it stood.</p>

<p>She looked up to see Erceldonne was gone, and Mrs.
Fuller standing by her.</p>

<p>“You had better go to bed,” the woman said, not unkindly.
“You are to sleep with me.”</p>

<p>But the girl never answered.</p>

<p>Oh! why had she not died with Andria?</p>

<p class="center">DREAMS.</p>


<p>As if she were blind and dumb Beryl Corselas followed
Mrs. Fuller up-stairs to a bedroom as bare as the rest of
the house.</p>

<p>The woman would have talked to her, but she shrank
away, conscious that she was a prisoner, and Mrs. Fuller
one of her jailers. She saw another thing as time went
on—that day and night changed places in this house.
There were no blazing fires in the daylight, only smoldering
coals that made no smoke that tell a tale of habitation.
And the doors were never unlocked, nor was she
ever alone to try them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fuller and Erceldonne were with her turn about.
Erle had vanished, and all count of time seemed to have
vanished, too.</p>

<p>Day after day went by, and Beryl never opened her
lips. Her sullen silence was as hopeless as her pale face,
but both got on the nerves of her jailers. If Lord Erceldonne
had dared, with what good-will he would have put
an end to them!</p>

<p>Raimond had gone to London, and sent back a letter
by the round-faced boy that made his father curse at each
day passed with nothing done. Would he never come
back? Was he out of his senses that he did not see there
was no time to lose? Why was he “unexpectedly detained”?</p>

<p>As the third week crawled by Lord Erceldonne lost
patience. Night after night he paced the gravel, listening
for the wheels that never came. But when the fourth
was gone, and the fifth, he dared not listen, for he imagined
wheels in each gust of wind. And the wind blew
eerily at nights over the moorland.</p>

<p>“The boy is mad!” he said to himself, aloud, alone in
that lonely room down-stairs, when the two women were
gone to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>Behind him some one laughed, or was it outside the
open window?</p>

<p>Lord Erceldonne forgot patience. He stared round
the empty room, flung open the thick wooden shutters
on the gusty spring night, and called aloud:</p>

<p>“Raimond! Raimond! Why the devil don’t you come
in?”</p>

<p>There was no answer. From far away he heard the
sound of a moorland brook that his strained ears had
surely turned into mocking laughter. Yet he drew
sharply back from the window, and shut it with frenzied
haste. It was no brook that had whispered in his very
ear from the darkness under the window.</p>

<p>“Mad, mad!” like an echo.</p>

<p>“It’s the solitude, the cursed waiting.” He wiped his
forehead. “It’s got on my nerves.”</p>

<p>For the whispers had been labored, un-English, as if
some one repeated sound, not sense; the voice that of the
madman on the island. Imagination was making a fool
of him; the thing was impossible. Yet he dared not go to
bed, and his thoughts even Mother Felicitas might not
have envied.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, in broad day, he fairly gasped
with astonishment, for his long-looked-for son drove up
to the door. Lord Erceldonne, opening it, could hardly
contain himself as he saw he was not alone. A quiet
man, in black clerical clothes, sat in the carriage.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” said Erceldonne in a whisper
almost soundless, as his son got out, “Who are you
bringing here? You’re mad—to dare!”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” returned Raimond, shaking hands as if he
greeted him. “Open some windows in this musty hole;
make everything look all right. This is the very man we
want, and an old friend of mine,” raising his voice,
“whom I’ve had hard work to find. Father Maurice,”
turning quickly, “this is my father. And he is afraid
you will find it rough work staying in a shooting-box like
this.”</p>

<p>“I have seen worse places,” said the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>As he stood on the door-step Erceldonne saw he was a
clergyman of the Church of Rome. Might have seen
also that here was a man impossible to coerce or deceive,
a strange friend for Raimond Erle; but Lord Erceldonne
was not the quick-eyed man he had been. Bad dreams
had wrought on his nerves.</p>

<p>“Raimond’s friends are always welcome,” he said
stiffly, “but we are indeed roughing it here,” and he
cursed Raimond silently for having called the place a
shooting-box when there was not a gun in the house.</p>

<p>And there were no servants! It was enough even to
make “an old friend” suspicious.</p>

<p>“Why did you bring him?” he said, when the priest
had been put in his own room for want of another habitable
one. “And where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Finding out things.” And now that they were alone
his face was haggard enough. “Do you know there is
five hundred reward offered for her? Some detective’s
at the bottom of it, but God knows who is offering the
money!”</p>

<p>“And you stayed away all this time, knowing that?”
cried Erceldonne, with uncurbed fury.</p>

<p>“I stayed because I could not help it. I had to get
some one to trust, and I had to scour all England for
this man,” little knowing by what chance he had found
him ready to come.</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“He had the honor,” said Erle cynically, “of marrying
me to the first Mrs. Erle!”</p>

<p>Erceldonne cursed him up and down for a fool.</p>

<p>“Then why, of all things, do you want him here?” he
ended.</p>

<p>“To marry me to the second. Oh, don’t waste your
breath! I know what you’re going to say, but it will be
legal enough this time. He had no right to do it before.
I found out afterward that it was before he had entered
the church. I can hold that over him if he kicks. But
he won’t. He’s sorry for me, because my wife died so
soon. He will tie this knot with true pleasure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“Do you think that sullen vixen up-stairs will have it
tied without raving to him? For I don’t.”</p>

<p>Erle laughed.</p>

<p>“I think she will,” he said suavely. “You can’t manage
women with sledge-hammers—unless they love you.
That’s where you go wrong! Take the priest out of the
way—anywhere—round the moors, and send Beryl here
to me. But don’t warn her I’m here.”</p>

<p>Out of doors a mountain mist had fallen, and the damp
twilight of it made him nervous as he waited. There
would be no coercing her if the wet drove Father Maurice
back before the work was done. He went to the
window, and fancied he saw the black figures of his
father and the priest dimly visible through the fog; and
turned impatiently to go to this Vashti who would not
come. But the door opened before he could reach it, and
even in the twilight he started at Beryl Corselas’ eyes.</p>

<p>“You!” she said, full of amazement not only at his
presence, but at the changed look of the room, whose
windows were unshuttered as she had never seen them.
But it had been a week and more since she had left her
bedroom, and they might well have grown careless.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “I—dear; what have they done to you
while I was gone? Have they frightened you? You
look so pale. I should never have left you. My father
is hasty, unjust! But I’ll take care of you now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to,” she said lifelessly. Her eyes
were on the window that was open to the fresh air, and
she went to it, like a prisoner who is strange to the light
of day.</p>

<p>Erle took no notice; it was too high from the ground
to be dangerous. He went to the fire, and threw on dry
wood till the room was light as day. There was no sense
in mystery or concealment now, since the thing must be
done and published before a week at farthest. After that
detectives could root out what they liked.</p>

<p>As he turned his back she leaned from the window,
and her helplessness stung her afresh as she breathed
the damp, sweet air. She was high above the ground,
there was not even grass to break the fall if she dared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
jump out. There was ivy, but not directly below the
window; its trails swayed at the sides out of her reach.
Swayed—she watched it with vague wonder. Why
should it move in the stirless air? Why did the woody
stems creak in the twilight at her right hand?</p>

<p>A log Erle laid on the fire slipped, and rolled blazing
on the hearth. He kicked it back impatiently, with a
noise that must have startled her in the silent room, for
she gave a queer, stifled cry.</p>

<p>“Confound the thing!” he said irritably, for the log
had slipped again. As he wrestled with it he did not notice
her lean from the window perilously, and stare
through the twilight at something that was not an ivy
branch; something that moved, but not with the chill,
evening air.</p>

<p>A lean hand she knew, a hand no one could mistake
who had once seen it, was stretched out to her from the
ivy where something clung like a hat. It pressed a scrap
of paper into her outstretched fingers; a voice whispered
in her very ear. But she had no time to hear the low
words; Erle’s light, delicate step was coming toward her.</p>

<p>Clutching a scrap of paper, she drew back from the
window just in time.</p>

<p>Erle was at her shoulder. And oh! was she mad as
they said, to dream she had seen the lunatic she had left
thousands of miles away? Her heart thumped till she
was sure Erle must hear it. How could she get rid of
him long enough to read that paper that seemed to sting
in her hand?</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he said quickly. “Don’t shake
like that; I’m not going to hurt you.”</p>

<p>He looked over her shoulder out the window, fearful
the wet would drive back his father and the priest; and
Beryl’s heart contracted. Had he seen—been nearer
than she knew?</p>

<p>“I’m cold!” she said sharply, and walked away from
him to the fire. If he had seen, that paper should burn
before he got it! But he did not even follow her.</p>

<p>“What has my father done to you?” he said, his worn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
handsome face haggard in the firelight. “But I needn’t
ask—I know! I was a fool ever to leave you.”</p>

<p>“Why? I did not miss you.” She stood before the
fire, her hands behind her back, so that her face was in
shadow, while the light played on his.</p>

<p>“Do listen and try to trust me,” he said slowly, hunting
for words that would terrify her into submission.
“You’ve made my father hate you, because of those wild
things you said of me when you were shocked, frightened,
not yourself. He’s a strange man, and takes fancies
that are soon over. His liking for you was one of
them.”</p>

<p>“He always hated me,” she said calmly.</p>

<p>Erle shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“That is nonsense. But what I am going to say is
earnest, horribly earnest. My father insists you are not
in your right mind, that——”</p>

<p>“I am the granddaughter of a madman.” She was
strangely cold by the fire. “Well?”</p>

<p>“He’s going to put you in an asylum,” replied Erle
brutally. “He will send you away to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Send her away! The house that was her prison
seemed suddenly the only place she could not leave.</p>

<p>“He can’t—he daren’t!” she cried. “I would tell all I
know.”</p>

<p>“A story of an island, of jaguars, of madness and sudden
death,” he continued slowly. “Can’t you see that
story would make any doctor call you mad? He wants
to get you out of his way; he would stick at nothing to
be rid of you.”</p>

<p>“Let me go there!” she muttered.</p>

<p>“Where?” He came toward her, his face changing.
“Beryl, do you know what I heard in London? Mother
Felicitas is offering a reward for you! How far would
you get before she would have you?”</p>

<p>“Mother Felicitas!” she recoiled. She had almost forgotten
her.</p>

<p>“A living grave in a convent, or in an asylum, there
is not much to choose.” He watched her standing rigid
with fear. “Don’t look like that!” he cried, as if pity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
had overmastered him. “You sha’n’t go to either. I’ll
help you; no one shall lay a finger on you.”</p>

<p>“You!”</p>

<p>“I know you hate me,” he said softly, “but I—love
you! I’ve forgotten all the cruel things you said, you
had had a shock that was enough to drive you wild.
And, hate me or not, I mean to take you out of my
father’s hands.”</p>

<p>“How?” But she knew.</p>

<p>“In the only way I can. Beryl, marry me. Come
away with me out of this nightmare.” He was not acting
now, for excellent reasons his very soul was in his
eyes. “What have I done to you, but tell you the truth
about a woman who was not fit to be near you? Come
to me and forget all that. You don’t know what life can
be. Are you going to throw yours away? If I could
convince my father you are in your right mind I would
not tell you all this, but I can’t. All I can do is to make
you my wife, and then not all the world can harm you.”</p>

<p>“It is your father who wants you to marry me,” she
broke in scornfully. “Why do you pretend?”</p>

<p>“My father would get me the earth if I fancied it.
And you may believe me, if he could see you dead rather
than my wife, it would suit him equally well, take it or
leave it.” For the first time there was a threat in his
voice. Where did she get her courage, that she never so
much as shrank as he leaned over her?</p>

<p>“To-morrow you can go to the asylum, or marry me!
After to-morrow I won’t try to save you. For all I care
you can do both!” The words were so easily said, so
sinister, that nothing but the scrap of paper in her hand
kept her from crying out.</p>

<p>“Scream if you choose,” he said, seeing her tightened
lips; “there is no one to hear you. Think, and try, and
place, you will see there is no one to help you but me.
Oh, Beryl, is it so hard to trust me! You make me
brutal, because you make me despair of helping you——”</p>

<p>“Liar! murderer!” she said in his face. For three
fierce sentences he had dropped his mask, and she knew
there was no love in him, but only most evil passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>She wrenched away from the hand he stretched out to
seize her, and ran from the room.</p>

<p>For once her own was empty. Mrs. Fuller was in the
kitchen making ready a decent meal with furious, incapable
fingers. Had she been able she would have poisoned
the man who forced her to be a servant in his
house. Beryl knelt by the fire, and unrolled the paper,
all creased from her hot clasp. The next instant she
threw it in the fire. It was all a trap. That hand she
thought she knew must have been another’s like enough
to serve, for the paper held only one sentence, in English,
that the madman did not know: “Do all they tell
you.”</p>

<p>Dull, lifelessly, Beryl watched it turn to ashes; saw
Mrs. Fuller come in and lay a white gown on the bed.
And Mrs. Fuller was crying, “Beryl,” and she threw her
arms around the motionless girl, “marry him. Give in.
Don’t you see?” she pointed to the bed, “it’s a wedding-dress,”
she sobbed, for she was frightened for herself
now.</p>

<p>“It will do very well,” said Beryl Corselas, with stiff
lips, “for a shroud.”</p>

<p class="center">TAKEN UNAWARES.</p>


<p>“You have a chapel?” asked Father Maurice.</p>

<p>He was an abstemious man; his vile dinner had not
troubled him. Indeed, if he had not been afraid to risk
weakness, he would not have eaten a crust in this house.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The late owners of the place had been Catholics.</p>

<p>“But it is disused; in sad repair.”</p>

<p>“It is the only place for a marriage,” said the priest,
and Raimond smiled, remembering the inn parlor in
which this very man had married him to Andria Heathcote.
“If you will allow me and provide me with some
candles, I will go and prepare it early in the morning.
You wished to have the wedding at seven?”</p>

<p>He looked at Raimond.</p>

<p>“At six. I should have liked you to have seen the
bride to-night, but——” he laughed, “well, she was shy!
I could not induce her to come down.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the priest hastily, and rose, that they
might not see his face. “I will go to my room if you
will excuse me. I am tired, and must rise early.”</p>

<p>“Your friend may be trustworthy, but he’s damnably
unpleasant,” said Erceldonne, as soon as the priest’s back
was turned.</p>

<p>“It won’t matter what he is to-morrow morning after
the register is signed.”</p>

<p>But even Erle was not easy about the task before him.</p>

<p>“Call Mrs. Fuller, will you? I want to talk to her.”</p>

<p>The low hum of their voices reached Father Maurice,
where he paced up and down his room. Regardless of
the damp outside, he opened his window and leaned out,
and if there had been any one to see his face, something
in it might have made them marvel. It was not the face
of a fool, or of a friend of Raimond Erle’s.</p>

<p>Then he did a strange thing for a priest and a guest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
He took off his shoes, and left the room without a sound.
He was gone perhaps ten minutes, and when he came
back there were only two voices in that murmur from the
room below. Mrs. Fuller’s was missing. He went to the
window again and scanned the misty darkness, as if he
expected some one, but nothing stirred.</p>

<p>“At dawn,” he thought. “I pray I have not acted unwisely.
There are many hours till dawn,” and he sat
listening and watching, long after the house was silent.</p>

<p>His task was abhorrent to him; he loathed this semblance
of doing evil that good might come, yet he saw
no way out of it. When the night changed to dawn, he
went his way to a deserted chapel that stood in the
grounds.</p>

<p>It was open, and he lit candles on the desolate altar.
He was strangely pale after his night’s vigil, and he
watched the growing light with grudging eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said suddenly. He turned away into the
moldy vestry and knelt down to pray. When he came
out into the empty chapel a beam of sunlight struggled
through the dusty glory of the stained windows, and
shone like an auriole round him as he stood in his vestments.
But to Erceldonne, who entered at that moment,
it looked as if the priest were bathed in blood.</p>

<p>Without speaking, he motioned to some one behind
him.</p>

<p>Raimond Erle took a girl’s passive hand and laid it on
his father’s arm; and passed on to the right hand of the
altar.</p>

<p>Step by step, Erceldonne advanced with a terror at his
heart for which he had no reason, since the license was
right, by what means his son best knew.</p>

<p>The bride, all in white, with a thick lace veil over her
dusky hair and pale face, never looked up as she leaned
on his arm; made no sign of surprise or dissent as she
saw the waiting priest.</p>

<p>Father Maurice, book in hand, never moved as they
approached him, but as they sank on their knees he
raised his hand, and his voice thrilled through the cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
chapel. But not in the familiar Latin Erceldonne, who
had been a Catholic when he was anything, expected.</p>

<p>“‘Behold, I will repay, saith the Lord,’” the strong,
clear words rang out over the kneeling wedding-party.
“‘I have laid a snare for thee, O Babylon; and thou art
also taken, for thou wast not aware.’”</p>

<p>“The Presbyterian will come out!” thought Erle,
mindful of the priest’s history, and never stirred a finger
at the magnificent cry of denunciation.</p>

<p>But Lord Erceldonne knew better.</p>

<p>He had seen the priest’s finger that pointed to something
behind him; had turned his head, sprung up, and
stood turned to stone.</p>

<p>The chapel was empty no longer.</p>

<p>Between him and the sunlight outside the open door,
between him and the desire of his eyes, stood two that
were risen from the dead. Behind them, strange men in
plain clothes. To Erceldonne the place seemed swarming.
He could not draw his breath, and he shook from him
the terrified woman’s hand that clutched his arm.</p>

<p>The strange pause made the bridegroom turn. But
even he could not speak.</p>

<p>Andria—Andria stood there, with her eyes on his.
And Heriot held her hand! Heriot, that was dead in
Flores!</p>

<p>Father Maurice stepped to Erle’s side, and touched
him lightly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Be glad,” he said, “that you have not had time to
take another sin upon you! There stands your wife,
whom you deserted and left to die. Go to her, ask her
pardon on your knees. You told her I was no priest;
that I had no right to marry you. I was a minister in
the Church of Scotland, and you know it. You were married
as hard and fast as I could marry you to-day, when
I am an unworthy servant of the Catholic church.”</p>

<p>But Erle never answered. He stood as if he did not
feel that hard, light hand on his shoulder, and stared at
the woman who was, after all, his wife.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” cried Erceldonne fiercely. He caught his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
son’s nerveless hand. “Raimond, it’s a plot! The
priest’s in some one’s pay!”</p>

<p>“The priest,” said Father Maurice, “is in the service
of God. Lord Erceldonne, I am the chaplain of St.
Mary’s Convent. It was Mother Felicitas who sent me
to find your son, and save an innocent girl.”</p>

<p>“Mother Felicitas!” But his jarring laugh stopped
unfinished. There was something in the priest’s face,
something in the absolute silence of the strange man at
the door, that killed his laughter in his throat.</p>

<p>“Your Mother Felicitas is a—a—you fool, she was my
mistress! She——”</p>

<p>“She is dead,” said Father Maurice, with a voice that
rang. “Her sins lie buried with her. Her confession is
in my hands, her repentance in the hands of God, her
temptations—are put down to the account of a man
whose crimes cry aloud. Long ago, Lord Erceldonne,
it seems to you, you tried to take from an old man by
violence his adopted daughter. Adopted, not his own, as
you well knew. Your elder brother saw you, saved her
in one of your own yacht’s boats, and married her.
When your elder brother died, leaving a wife and a young
child, who was it sent a woman to them? A woman,
who thought herself your wife, who loved you till she
forgot God in heaven; a desperate, miserable woman,
who saw nothing but that her son and yours was disinherited
if that little girl lived. Who gave her the morphin
that killed Lady Erceldonne? Who asked no
questions when the child disappeared and was never
found? Who, when a most unhappy woman came to
him with all her sins on her head, laughed and told her
she was no wife of his—that she and her son were nameless?</p>

<p>“She had done your work. You had no more need of
her. But, to keep her lips shut, you promised to care for
her boy, to bring him up away from you, but happily, as
long as she was silent. And silent she was—till she
learned how you kept your promise. How you wearied
of supporting the lad, and sent him to the other side of
the world to be killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>“You had no thought, Lord Erceldonne, that such a
sinner would confess; that the girl you kidnaped and
meant to let die would be your ruin, as soon as you
found out that if she lived her mother’s money would set
you on your feet. You said she was a madman’s daughter,
and you knew all the time she was of the best blood
in Spain. A child who was a born dompteuse, an animal-tamer,
who had run away to a circus, whose owner
retired and took her and his animals to his home in the
Azores. Her brother died a year ago; since then, you
know best how every part of the world has been ransacked
for the daughter of the lost sister, to whom he
left his fortune. Beryl, she was christened, for a ring
her mother had always worn till she left the circus;
Corselas, because the murdered Lady Erceldonne always
hoped to take the child to Spain and find her relatives.
It was under that name, which seemed a fancy one, that
she was left at the convent. That name, which has led
to the unraveling of all. The church’s arm is long, Lord
Erceldonne, for you. For that most miserable woman,
Mother Felicitas, her mercy is infinite.”</p>

<p>“You have no proofs! It is a conspiracy, a lie!” said
Erceldonne, but his lips were white.</p>

<p>“This is not a court of justice, nor am I your judge,”
returned Father Maurice icily. He beckoned to the men
at the door, but some one was nearer, quicker than they.</p>

<p>From an empty vestry there ran a strange figure, bent
almost double, that screamed in Spanish as it ran.</p>

<p>“Liar! You said you knew nothing of her? You
swore you had no brother. You took the light from my
eyes with your story of a stranger, and her shame.”</p>

<p>Before any one could reach him, the jabbering thing
had sprung at Erceldonne’s back, and stabbed him with
that very dagger that had lain so long idle in his own
house.</p>

<p>A shriek ran through the chapel, but it was not Lord
Erceldonne’s; he lay quiet on the stone floor, face down.</p>

<p>It was Salome, whom he had wronged, whose life had
been hell through him; and the shriek was savage, exultant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>“Be silent,” said Andria fiercely.</p>

<p>As she spoke, the madman flew by her, running and
leaping like a monkey, two of the strange men at his
heels.</p>

<p>What was the matter with Beryl, that she neither
spoke nor came to her; that she never looked up as
Heriot laid a hand on her shoulder? Had they drugged
her—was she——</p>

<p>Andria Erle ran to the strange figure that was hidden
under the lace veil.</p>

<p>“Beryl!” she cried, “it’s I, Andria! You’re safe!”</p>

<p>She put the veil back from the face and stared aghast.</p>

<p>A strange woman stood before her, painted, hollow-eyed;
her head covered with long locks cut from Beryl’s
hair, wound deftly round it.</p>

<p>“Father! Father Maurice!” cried Andria, in the one
breathless instant before the priest could speak and tell
her this strange bride was part of his last night’s work.
She turned and ran from the church like an arrow from
the bow after some one else who had also stared unbelievingly
at the false bride.</p>

<p>All she thought was that this was not Beryl, and that
Raimond had had a minute’s start of her in the confusion,
when all eyes were on the escaping madman and
the dead man on the floor.</p>

<p>Across the wet grass, in the light of the wet morning
sun, she ran, into the desolate house. Up-stairs, through
endless passages, sobbing, stumbling, calling, she went
in wild fear.</p>

<p>And each door she opened showed an empty room,
each passage led to nothing.</p>

<p>“Beryl!” she screamed. “Beryl!” and from somewhere
heard a sound.</p>

<p>She was here, then. And she had read Raimond’s face
aright.</p>

<p>“Heriot! Father Maurice!” Andria shrieked from a
stair-window, and dared not wait for their coming. She
ran on blindly, and burst into the room that was Beryl’s
and Mrs. Fuller’s.</p>

<p>There, having waited irresolute a little too long, instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
of running to the carriage Father Maurice had told
her would be waiting by the chapel, was Beryl Corselas
struggling hideously with a man, who had also a carriage
waiting with a bullet-headed boy for driver.</p>

<p>“Raimond!” Andria cried. “Run—they are coming!
Let her go.”</p>

<p>At her voice he let Beryl go; stood an instant, staring.</p>

<p>“Go!” said Andria, in a dreadful whisper. “Go!
Thank God that I am your wife, and must hold my
tongue. It is my shame that I ever loved you.”</p>

<p>“Andria,” said her husband softly, very easily. “The
Lovely Andria!”</p>

<p>He came toward her, with the long, easy step she had
loved.</p>

<p>“Devil!” he cried, and struck her between the eyes.</p>

<p>But there was no force in the blow. A girl’s whole
weight had caught him back from behind. He shook it
off, and ran down a back stair. Lord Erceldonne’s son
had nothing to stay for.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE EXPIATION OF MOTHER FELICITAS.</p>


<p>“Andria!” said Beryl wildly, unbelievingly.</p>

<p>“Andria, they told me you were dead.”</p>

<p>She had never spoken when the woman she thought
dead had run in; pale, breathlessly, but Andria herself
and no ghost. She had only gazed dumfounded; then
leaped with the instinct of an animal, and caught Erle’s
arm as he would have paid his debt to his wife in full.</p>

<p>“Oh! how did you get here?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you in a minute.”</p>

<p>Erle’s fist had only grazed her, yet she was leaning
helplessly against the wall. She hated him, despised
him, and yet—he had struck her; and if he had held out
a finger instead she would have gone to the ends of the
earth with him still. He was gone out of her sight forever.
What ailed her that she could not be glad?</p>

<p>“Didn’t know I was coming?” she forced herself to
speak. “Didn’t Father Maurice tell you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but that Mrs. Fuller was to take my place
and I was to run to the carriage. We spoke to her out
in the hall, and she was like a child. She did everything
he said. She hated Erceldonne, but she was afraid of
him. She had owed him money she could not pay; he
had her note and could have taken everything she had.
Father Maurice told her I would pay everything she
owed if she helped me. It was she who thought of cutting
off my hair for a wig. Oh, never mind all that!
Tell me what has happened?”</p>

<p>She dared not ask for Heriot, lest only one, not two,
might have come back alive from Flores.</p>

<p>“Look!” said Andria gently. “Salome and the poor
old man saved us.”</p>

<p>Her heart contracted as she thought of the lunatic running
over the moors for his life. He had seemed sane
enough till now; had begged them with tears to take him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
to England to see the dearest of his soul again. Had been
times messenger to Beryl before they dared come themselves,
and now would finish his life in an asylum, away
from the animals that he loved.</p>

<p>But Beryl thought of only one thing, one person.
Here in the doorway, behind the priest, stood Brian
Heriot, alive. He stretched out his hands, and she ran
to him. At the sight the woman whom love would know
no more turned away.</p>

<p>“Father Maurice,” she said, “let us get away from this
dreadful place.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” the priest whispered, “they are bringing him
in. It is better for her not to see.”</p>

<p>“Him!” she stammered, thinking of the man who had
run from the house.</p>

<p>“Lord Erceldonne.”</p>

<p>He laid a hand on her arm.</p>

<p>“Mr. Erle has gone,” he said quietly, knowing she
would never speak that name again. “I must stay and
arrange matters for the funeral.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t really understand yet,” Beryl cried out
still in the embrace of Heriot. “You were shot and——”</p>

<p>“The poor old crazy man you sent saved me. Salome
nursed me back to life again.”</p>

<p>“The old man!” she cried, with a cry that stopped
Father Maurice and Andria in their low talk. Beryl
dragged her hand from Heriot’s.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” she said, “don’t touch me! I am his
granddaughter. It was no wonder I could manage the
cats. I am like him, I——”</p>

<p>“You are no relation to him,” said Father Maurice
quietly. “Your mother was his adopted daughter; but
he had gone too crazy to remember it. She ran away
from him and married Lord Erceldonne’s elder brother.
You are their daughter.”</p>

<p>“My mother?” she said, in a thick whisper.</p>

<p>“Died long ago,” he would not tell her how yet, “and
you were stolen and hidden away in the convent. Only
Mother Felicitas knew you were the heiress of Erceldonne.
The Lord Erceldonne you knew had never any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
right to the title, which is one of the few that descend
in direct line to male or female heirs. You would have
been left to die on that island, but for a fortune left you
by your mother’s brother. The papers were full of advertisements
for you; so, you see, you were suddenly
worth more alive than dead. A marriage with you
would not only secure the succession to Raimond Erle,
but set him and his father on their feet as to money.
You would not have been told of your parentage till you
were married. A penniless waif might accept without
question a husband whom a viscountess in her own right
would refuse.”</p>

<p>“But Andria! He couldn’t have married me.”</p>

<p>“Not if she lived. But he thought her dead. It was
she, under Heaven, who saved you. Raimond Erle was
married to her by me, at that time a minister in the
Presbyterian church, who had given up my charge because
I could not preach those things I no longer believed.
When he heard, afterward, that I had become a
priest of the Catholic church, he made use of it to tell
her she was not, nor never had been, his wife.</p>

<p>“Wife or no wife, she was a menace to him; he left
her to die. The black servant saved her; the madman
gave money to her and Mr. Heriot which brought them
to England; to Mother Felicitas, to me, who had performed
the ceremony Erle dared call null and void.”</p>

<p>“Mother Felicitas!” she cried. “Do you mean I must
go back to her? I won’t! I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Mother Felicitas is dead,” the priest said gravely.
“But you are wrong to hate her. She was your friend—in
the end. It was she who, when Erceldonne was found
tenantless, thought of this Moorland house. She, who,
on hearing Mrs. Erle’s story, sent for me, the chaplain of
the convent, the only person in all England, by God’s
grace, who knew of her marriage. I went to London
and discovered Mr. Erle as if by accident; I seemed to
believe all he told me. And when I came to this evil
house, his wife, Heriot, and the police were at my heels.
But I had no time to tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>“But Mother Felicitas,” she said incredulously. “She
hates me!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered slowly, “she hated you, but not as
you thought. She was a great sinner, but she died like
a martyr. She repented.”</p>

<p>Even now he remembered with how great a courage.
There had been no half-measures in her atonement; no
shielding of herself, or of that reputation that had been
dearer than life.</p>

<p>He had been as stunned as the nuns when, after a
service for the dead for which she asked him, the Mother
Superior had risen in her stall in the chapel and faced
them all—every nun in the convent and himself.</p>

<p>She was the color of ashes, even to her lips; and she
swayed as she stood.</p>

<p>She began very quietly; she asked their prayers, their
patience.</p>

<p>When her long story was done, each nun was on her
knees. Was the reverent mother raving, that she should
call herself a murderess, a hypocrite, a blasphemer?
That she gave chapter and verse of her sins, her great
humiliation?</p>

<p>She stood in the silence that was full of hushed weeping,
and beckoned to the convent chaplain, then led the
way to the confessional.</p>

<p>In agony she wrote a deposition, in agony she gave
those directions that had saved Beryl Corselas, and fell
on her knees.</p>

<p>“You will excommunicate me!” she said.</p>

<p>Father Maurice had raised his hands, and spoken.
And as he finished a great cry rang out to the listening
nuns.</p>

<p>He had absolved her, as One Higher than he had forgiven
the dying thief on the cross. But when he would
have raised her from her knees, she was dead.</p>

<p>He roused himself now, and looked for a long moment
at Beryl Corselas.</p>

<p>“Pray,” he said gently, “that you may make as good
an ending.” Then he went away, to begin his watch by
the dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“Come,” said Heriot softly. “Let us go.”</p>

<p>And, with Andria’s hand in hers, Beryl Corselas, who
was Beryl Corselas no longer, left that house of crime.</p>

<p>There is little more to tell.</p>

<p>The madman who had paid his lifelong debt to Lord
Erceldonne was never found. If he perished miserably
on the wild moorlands, his misshapen bones were never
discovered; if with the cunning of madness, he made his
way back to the Azores, there was no one who suggested
it to the police, though perhaps Andria Erle might
have been able to, had she wished.</p>

<p>Raimond Erle, rather than face bankruptcy and disinheritance,
slipped away to Mexico; and there he died in a
gambling-brawl.</p>

<p>In his stead there reigned Beryl, Viscountess Erceldonne,
whose husband was the Honorable Brian Heriot,
next heir to the baronage of Heriot, for his brother never
married. He was true to his word; he never touched a
penny of her vast fortune. She spent it nearly all in
helping the outcast and wretched.</p>

<p>The sham Mrs. Fuller was a white slave no more.
She lived at peace with the husband she loved—the man
whom Lord Erceldonne had sworn to ruin, and thus had
maintained an overmastering influence over her.</p>

<p>Ebenezer Davids lighted lamps no more. He and his
wife left the lodge at the great gate of Erceldonne, and
he prided himself greatly that it was he who first discovered
his present mistress was “the spit and image of his
lordship.”</p>

<p>And the whole truth about Mother Felicitas Lady
Erceldonne never knew. There is no loyalty like that of
religious women. Not a nun in the convent ever opened
her lips, not one but was helped on the narrow path by
the memory of the expiation of Mother Felicitas.</p>

<p>Salome, faithful still, worshiped Beryl’s child, which
was named Andria.</p>

<p>And Andria?</p>

<p>At twenty-four no one can say their life is done.</p>

<p>Andria Erle took up hers and was living it, not a pensioner
on Beryl’s bounty, nor a nun in a convent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>On the boards of the Queen’s Theater she became an
actress whom princes were glad to applaud, whom great
ladies visit. Men laid titles and fortunes at her feet,
but she remained Andria Erle; beautiful, gentle, and a
little unapproachable!</p>

<p>Time, instead of adding lines to her face, had
smoothed the hardness and bitterness from it.</p>

<p>But to no one had she ever spoken of Raimond Erle.</p>
